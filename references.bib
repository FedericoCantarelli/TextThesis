	abstract = {In this era of technology, programming has become more significant than ever before. Python and C++ are both widely used programming languages. Python, the most popular programming language in today’s world, is a high-level object-oriented language whereas C++, the language behind most operating systems, is a low-level object-oriented language. In this paper, we present a comparative study of Python and C++. This paper discusses the introduction to these languages, their memory management techniques, and the reasons behind their program execution speed. Furthermore, we analyzed the execution time and memory used by multiple algorithms in both the languages with best, average, and worst cases. They are also compared with respect to the benefits and issues related to them. Results indicate that C++ is faster than Python in execution speed but Python serves as a better language for beginners due to its simplicity. Moreover, for the best results, the language should be selected according to the type of project.},

Critical quality issues such as porosity, surface roughness, crack, and delamination continue to present challenges within SLM-manufactured parts. Monitoring and in-process defect diagnosis are the key to improving the final part quality. Currently, it greatly hinders the adaptability and the development within the defect detection system since the setup restricts the vision and photo diode applications in the SLM process monitoring. Additionally, defect detection with traditional classification approaches makes the system rather complex due to introducing a series of steps. To meet these needs, this study proposes a novel method for the defect detection within the SLM parts. The setup was flexibly conducted using a microphone, and the defect detection was obtained by the framework of deep belief network (DBN). It is implemented by a simplified classification structure without signal preprocessing and feature extraction. The experimental results showed that the utilization of acoustic signals was workable for quality monitoring, and the DBN approach could reach high defect detection rate among five melted states without signal preprocessing.},

Despite its unrivaled capability for directly fabricating metal parts with complex geometries, the wide realization of the technology is currently limited by microstructural defects and anomalies, which could significantly degrade the structural integrity and service performance of the product. Accurate detection, characterization, and prediction of these defects and anomalies have an important and immediate impact in manufacturing fullydense and defect-free builds. This review seeks to elucidate common defects/anomalies and their formation mechanisms in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes. They could arise from raw materials, processing conditions, and post-processing. While defects/anomalies in laser welding have been studied exten­ sively, their formation and evolution remain unclear. Additionally, the existence of powder in powder bed fusion techniques may generate new types of defects, e.g., porosity transferring from powder to builds. Practical strategies to mitigate defects are also addressed through fundamental understanding of their formation. Such explorations enable the validation and calibration of models and ease the process qualification without costly trial-and-error experimentation.},

	abstract = {In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) the surface layer temperature is continually changing throughout the build process. Variations in part geometry, scanned cross-section and number of parts all influence the thermal field within a build. Process parameters do not take these variations into account and this can result in increased porosity and differences in local microstructure and mechanical properties, undermining confidence in the structural integrity of a part. In this paper a wide-field in situ infra-red imaging system is developed and calibrated to enable measurement of both solid and powder surface temperatures across the full powder bed. The influence of inter-layer cooling time is investigated using a build scenario with cylindrical components of differing heights. In situ surface temperature data are acquired throughout the build process and are compared to results from porosity, microstructure and mechanical property investigations. Changes in surface temperature of up to 200 °C are attributed to variation in inter-layer cooling time and this is found to correlate with density and grain structure changes in the part. This work shows that these changes are significant and must be accounted for to improve the consistency and structural integrity of LPBF components.},

	abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) has been attracting a growing interest in different industrial sectors as it is one of the key technologies for metal additive manufacturing (AM). Despite the relevant improvements made by the SLM technology in the recent years, process capability is still a major issue for its industrial breakthrough. As a matter of fact, different kinds of defect may originate during the layerwise process. In some cases, they propagate from one layer to the following ones leading to a job failure. In other cases, they are hardly visible and detectable by inspecting the final part, as they can affect the internal structure or structural features that are difficult to measure. This implies the need for in-process monitoring methods able to rapidly detect and locate defect onsets during the process itself. Different authors have been investigating machine sensorization architectures, but the development of statistical monitoring techniques is still in a very preliminary phase. This paper proposes a method for the detection and spatial identification of defects during the layerwise process by using a machine vision system in the visible range. A statistical descriptor based on principal component analysis (PCA) applied to image data is presented, which is suitable to identify defective areas of a layer. The use of image k-means clustering analysis is then proposed for automated defect detection. A real case study in SLM including both simple and complicated geometries is discussed to demonstrate the performances of the method.},

The number of research studies in this field has been characterised by significant growth in the last few years, with several advances and new solutions compared with first seminal works. Moreover, industrial powder bed fusion (PBF) systems are increasingly equipped with sensors and toolkits for data collection, visualisation and, in some cases, embedded in-process analysis. Many new methods have been proposed and defect detection capabilities have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, several challenges and open issues still need to be tackled to bridge the gap between methods proposed in the literature and actual industrial implementation. This paper presents an updated review of the literature on in-situ sensing, measurement and monitoring for metal PBF processes, with a classification of methods and a comparison of enabled performances. The study summarises the types and sizes of defects that are practically detectable while the part is being produced and the research areas where additional technological advances are currently needed.},

Monitoring is a key tool for this purpose but the typical AM fast process dynamics and the high data ﬂow required to accurately describe the process are pushing the limits of standard statistical process monitoring (SPM) techniques. The adoption of novel smart data extraction and analysis methods are fundamental to monitor the process with the required accuracy while keeping the computational effort to a reasonable level for real-time application. In this work, a new framework for the detection of defects in metal additive manufacturing processes via in-situ high-speed cameras is presented: a new data extraction method is developed to efﬁciently extract only the relevant information from the regions of interest identiﬁed in the high-speed imaging data stream and to reduce the dimensionality of the anomaly detection task performed by three competitor machine learning classiﬁcation methods. The defect detection performance and computational speed of this approach is carefully evaluated through computer simulations and experimental studies, and directly compared with the performance and computational speed of other existing methods applied on the same reference dataset. The results show that the proposed method is capable of quickly detecting the occurrence of defects while keeping the high computational speed that would be required to implement this new process monitoring approach for real-time defect detection.},

Thermo-mechanical simulations are used to develop a better understanding of the process and to determine residual stresses and distortions based on the temperature history. In these numerically very complex simulations, modeling assumptions are often made that reduce computational eﬀort but lead to inaccuracies. These assumptions include the omission of the surrounding powder or the use of geometrically linearized material models. The numerical setting, in particular the temporal and spatial discretizations, can further lead to discretization errors. Here, a highly parallelized and adaptive ﬁnite element method based on the open source C++ library deal.II is validated and utilized, to investigate some of these modeling assumptions and to identify the required temporal and spatial discretizations for the simulation of PBF of Ti-6Al-4V. The insights initially gained on a simple wall-like geometry are transferred to a larger open rectangular proﬁle where the results of a detailed simulation are compared with those of a more eﬃcient one. The results for the eﬃcient approach show a maximum deviation of ≈ 8\% in the displacements and ≈ 3.5\% in the residual stresses while signiﬁcantly reducing the computational time.},

The microstructure and the thermo-mechanical properties of the components vary according to the process parameters adopted in the manufacturing process. Physically accurate modeling of the powder bed fusion process can play a vital role in the qualification of components and materials and also can help in pre­ dicting the experimental observations. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state of the art referred to numerical simulation of powder bed fusion, by covering both mesh based approaches such as finite element modeling, finite volume modeling and mesh free methods such as the discrete element modeling, the lattice Boltzmann method, the optimal transportation method and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics approach. Combined approaches of different methods are discussed as well. A case study comparing two different types of models for a similar type of problem has been provided.

The model is established based on the moving point heat source under a semi-infinite medium. A modified coefficient is utilized to calibrate the temperature along the build direction. The heat sink is adopted to consider the heat loss at the edge of the build part, and the superposition method is applied to calculate the multi-tracks effect of the laser beam. The material thermal properties are dependent on the temperature, and an iteration method is utilized to obtain the dynamic stable melt pool during the process. To validate the proposed model, the experimental data in the published paper are compared with the model predictions. Good agreement is found about the melt pool size. Based on the verified model, a sensitivity analysis of temperature with respect to the laser process parameters, the material properties, and the geometry of the build part is discussed. Both the depth and width of the melt pool have a negative relationship with the size of the part within the explored range. It is also shown that the size of the melt pool has a negative correlation with the length of the previous track, which is determined by the shape of the build part.},

In this framework, spatio-temporal statistical process monitoring methods are needed to capture the relevant information content and signal possible out-of-control states. Video-imaging data are characterized by a spatio-temporal variability structure that depends on the underlying phenomenon, and typical out-of-control patterns are related to events that are localized both in time and space. In this article, we propose an integrated spatio-temporal decomposition and regression approach for anomaly detection in video-imaging data. Out-of-control events are typically sparse, spatially clustered and temporally consistent. The goal is not only to detect the anomaly as quickly as possible (“when”) but also to locate it in space (“where”). The proposed approach works by decomposing the original spatio-temporal data into random natural events, sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent anomalous events, and random noise. Recursive estimation procedures for spatio-temporal regression are presented to enable the real-time implementation of the proposed methodology. Finally, a likelihood ratio test procedure is proposed to detect when and where the anomaly happens. The proposed approach was applied to the analysis of high-sped video-imaging data to detect and locate local hot-spots during a metal additive manufacturing process.},

This study presents a spatiotemporal method based on principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize and synthetize the information content of image streams for statistical process monitoring.

Many parameters influence the printing process; however, defects resulting from suboptimal parameter settings are usually detected after the process. To detect these defects during the printing, different process monitoring techniques such as melt pool monitoring or off-axis infrared monitoring have been proposed. In this work, we used a combination of thermographic off-axis imaging as data source and deep learning-based neural network architectures, to detect printing defects. For the network training, a k-fold cross validation and a hold-out cross validation were used. With these techniques, defects such as delamination and splatter can be recognized with an accuracy of 96.80\%. In addition, the model was evaluated with computing class activation heatmaps.

	abstract = {Part quality manufactured by the laser powder bed fusion process is signiﬁcantly affected by porosity. Existing works of process–property relationships for porosity prediction require many experiments or computationally expensive simulations without considering environmental variations. While efforts that adopt real-time monitoring sensors can only detect porosity after its occurrence rather than predicting it ahead of time. In this study, a novel porosity detection-prediction framework is proposed based on deep learning that predicts porosity in the next layer based on thermal signatures of the previous layers. The proposed framework is validated in terms of its ability to accurately predict lack of fusion porosity using computerized tomography (CT) scans, which achieves a F1-score of 0.75. The framework presented in this work can be effectively applied to quality control in additive manufacturing. As a function of the predicted porosity positions, laser process parameters in the next layer can be adjusted to avoid more part porosity in the future or the existing porosity could be ﬁlled. If the predicted part porosity is not acceptable regardless of laser parameters, the building process can be stopped to minimize the loss.},

	abstract = {In laser powder bed fusion, melt pool dynamics and stability are driven by the temperature field in the melt pool. If the temperature field is unfavourable defects are likely to form. The localised and rapid heating and cooling in the process presents a challenge for the experimental methods used to measure temperature. As a result, understanding of these process fundamentals is limited. In this paper a method is developed that uses coaxial imaging with high-speed cameras to give both the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to resolve the surface temperature of the melt pool. A two wavelength imaging setup is used to account for changes in emissivity. Temperature fields are captured at 100 kHz with a resolution of 20 μm during the processing of a simple Ti6Al4V component. Thermal gradients in the range 5–20 K/μm and cooling rates in range 1–40 K/μs are measured. The results presented give new insight into the effect of parameters, geometry and scan path on the melt pool temperature and cooling rates. The method developed here provides a new tool to assist in optimising scan strategies and parameters, identifying the causes of defect prone locations and controlling cooling rates for local microstructure development.},

	abstract = {In-situ co-axial meltpool monitoring has become a popular tool for digitising the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process , providing baseline data for certiﬁcation. Each layer produces an image where the pixel position represents the laser coordinates and the pixel intensity denotes the sensor response. The 3D image stacks represent the infrared emission during the manufacturing of the physical component. However, interpreting monitoring data remains a challenge. To address this issue, this study evaluates the performance of a near-infrared photodiode in detecting typical geometrical features such as porosity and overhanging structures ranging from the micro-to-meso scale. Monitoring data is highly sensitive to heat accumulation around overhanging structures and can quantify dross formation based on hotspots. Cold spots, which represent a lack of fusion porosity at scan track intersections, can indicate a probability of defect formation. However, the sensitivity and predictive value of monitoring data for porosity are low due to the healing of defects in subsequent layers. Local process variables, such as the scan strategy and part orientation, signiﬁcantly inﬂuence dross and hot spot formation. This study shows the potential of NIR photodiodes in deriving metrics for in-line certiﬁcation of L-PBF components, leading to improved process control and quality assurance.},

Nature abounds with examples of cellular materials that are able to achieve multifunctionality, but designers lack the ability to translate the underlying principles in these examples to their design tools.

	abstract = {The production of novel types of complex shapes is nowadays enabled by new manufacturing paradigms such as additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing. The continuous increase of shape complexity imposes new challenges in terms of inspection, product qualification and process monitoring methodologies. Previously proposed methods for 2.5D freeform surfaces are no longer applicable in the presence of this kind of new full 3D geometries. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by presenting a statistical quality monitoring approach for structures that cannot be described in terms of parametric models. The goal consists of identifying out-of-control geometrical distortions by analyzing either local variations within the part or changes from part to part. The proposed approach involves an innovative solution for modeling the deviation between the nominal geometry (the originating 3D model) and the real geometry (measured via x-ray computed tomography) by slicing the shapes and estimating the deviation slice by slice. 3D deviation maps are then transformed into 1D deviation profiles enabling the use of a profile monitoring scheme for local defect detection. The feasibility and potential of this method are demonstrated by focusing on a category of complex shapes where an elemental geometry regularly repeats in space. These shapes are known as lattice structures, or metamaterials, and their trabecular shape is thought to provide innovative mechanical and functional performance. The performance of the proposed method is shown in real and simulated case studies.},

This can be achieved with cellular materials, such as honeycombs, foams and lattices. Designing structures with cellular materials involves answering an important question: What is the optimum unit cell for the application of interest? There is currently no classiﬁcation framework that describes the spectrum of cellular materials, and no methodology to guide the designer in selecting among the inﬁnite list of possibilities. In this paper, we ﬁrst review traditional engineering methods currently in use for selecting cellular materials in design. We then develop a classiﬁcation scheme for the different types of cellular materials, dividing them into three levels of design decisions: tessellation, element type and connectivity. We demonstrate how a biomimetic approach helps a designer make decisions at all three levels. The scope of this paper is limited to the structural domain, but the methodology developed here can be extended to the design of components in thermal, ﬂuid, optical and other areas. A deeper purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how traditional methods in design can be combined with a biomimetic approach.},

	abstract = {This review article summarizes the current state-of-the-art for biomimicry in additive manufacturing. Biomimicry is the practice of learning from and emulating nature - which can be increasingly realized in engineering applications due to progress in additive manufacturing (AM). AM has grown tremendously in recent years, with improvements in technology and resulting material properties sometimes exceeding those of equivalent parts produced by traditional production processes. This has led to the industrial use of AM parts even in highly critical applications, most notably in aerospace, automotive and medical applications. The ability to create parts with complex geometries is one of the most important advantages of this technology, allowing the production of complex functional objects from various materials including plastics and metals that cannot be easily produced by any other means. Utilizing the full complexity allowed by AM is the key to unlocking the huge potential of this technology for real world applications – and biomimicry might be pivotal in this regard. Biomimicry may take different forms in AM, including customization of parts for individuals (e.g. medical prosthesis, implants or custom sports equipment), or optimization for specific properties such as stiffness and light-weighting (e.g. lightweight parts in aerospace or automotive applications). The optimization process often uses an iterative simulation-driven process analogous to biological evolution – with an improvement in every iteration. Other forms of biomimicry in AM include the incorporation of real biological inputs into designs (i.e. emulating nature for its unique properties); the use of cellular or lattice structures – for various applications and customized to the application; incorporating multi-functionality into designs; the consolidation of numerous parts into one and the reduction of waste, amongst others. Numerous biomimetic design approaches may be used – broadly categorized into customized/freeform, simulation-driven and lattice designs. All these approaches may be used in combination with one another, and in all cases with or without direct input from nature. The aim of this review is to unravel the different forms of biomimetic engineering that are now possible – focusing mainly on functional mechanical engineering for end-use parts, i.e. not for prototyping. The current limits of each design approach are discussed and the most exciting future opportunities for biomimetic AM applications are highlighted.},

	abstract = {In today‘s modern times, where unsustainability threatens the very existence of mankind, revival of the philosophy of BIOMIMICRY opens up an avenue of probable solutions. It is an emerging horizon that looks to the natural world for ideas and inspiration for all kinds of design opportunities. In the search of sustainable building design and technology Biomimicry is an alternative solution. The inspiration from nature is driving force in architecture, resulting in majestic works of architecture. Biomimicry is about solution refined and developed by nature. These principles help designers to create products, processes, and policies that are well adapted to life on earth in its long run. Sometimes human designed solutions are cruder and more additive than the nature‘s solutions of the same problem. As we seek new ways to design and live sustainably, and in many cases have solved the same problems with a far greater economy of means. It is a design principle seeking sustainable solutions to divert attention towards nature‘s solution for human problems by consulting and emulating nature‘s tested and tried patterns and strategies. The primary idea is that necessity requires nature to be imaginative. Through this imagination, nature has successfully solved many of the problems that designers today are still struggling to solve. The behavioral and operational systems of the nature have a lot to teach and inspire us, provided we as architects and designers open our eyes towards it. The core idea is that nature already has all the remedies hidden in its deepest sanctuaries, we just have to be insolent and find it. Nature‘s consummate engineers – flora and fauna, have held in themselves the secret of survival. Aim is revealing how radical increase in resource efficiency can be achieved by looking to the nature for inspiration. For any sustainable building design, structural efficiency, water efficiency, zero-waste systems, thermal environment, and energy efficiency, Biomimicry is all about deriving solutions from nature.},

When processing the fresh, as-received powder in a wellcontrolled environment, the oxide inclusions contained in the precursor powder were the primary contributors to the formation of nano-scale oxides in the ﬁnal additive manufactured (AM) product. These oxide inclusions were found to be enriched with oxygen getter elements like Si and Mn. By controlling the extraneous oxygen level in the process environment, the oxygen level in AM produced parts was found to increase with the extraneous oxygen level. The intrusion pathway of this extra oxygen was found to be dominated by the incorporation of spatter particles into the build during processing. Moisture induced oxidation during powder storage was also found to result in a higher oxide density in the AM produced parts. SS 316L powder free of Si and Mn oxygen getters was processed in a well-controlled environment and resulted in a similar level of oxygen intrusion. Microhardness testing indicated that the oxide volume fraction increase from extraneous oxygen did not inﬂuence hardness values. However, a marked decrease in hardness was found for the humidiﬁed and Si-Mn free AM processed parts.},

Surface topography investigations of as-built, nickel alloy (625) surfaces were performed by obtaining areal height maps using focus variation microscopy for samples produced at various energy density settings and two different scan strategies. Surface areal height maps and measured surface texture parameters revealed the highly irregular nature of surface topography created by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Effects of process parameters and energy density on the areal surface texture have been identified. Machine learning methods were applied to measured data to establish input and output relationships between process parameters and measured surface texture parameters with predictive capabilities. The advantages of utilizing such predictive models for process planning purposes are highlighted.},

The evolution of this precision manufacturing process from rapid prototyping to ready-to-use parts has significantly alleviated manufacturing constraints and design freedom has been outstandingly widened. AM is a non-conventional manufacturing technique which utilizes a 3D CAD model data to build parts by adding one material layer at a time, rather than removing it and fulfills the demand for manufacturing parts with complex geometric shapes, great dimensional accuracy, and easy to assemble parts. Additive manufacturing of metals has become the area of extensive research, progressing towards the production of final products and replacing conventional manufacturing methods. This paper provides an insight to the available metal additive manufacturing technologies that can be used to produce end user products without using conventional manufacturing methods. The paper also includes the comparison of mechanical and physical properties of parts produced by AM with the parts manufactured using conventional processes.},

	abstract = {In many modern applications, including analysis of gene expression and text documents, the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and unordered–with no particular meaning to the given order of the variables. Yet, successful learning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that the data are typically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only a few features. In this paper we present treelets–a novel construction of multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth signals. The method is fully adaptive, as it returns a hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis which both reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are especially well-suited as a dimensionality reduction and feature selection tool prior to regression and classification, in situations where sample sizes are small and the data are sparse with unknown groupings of correlated or collinear variables. The method is also simple to implement and analyze theoretically. Here we describe a variety of situations where treelets perform better than principal component analysis, as well as some common variable selection and cluster averaging schemes. We illustrate treelets on a blocked covariance model and on several data sets (hyperspectral image data, DNA microarray data, and internet advertisements) with highly complex dependencies between variables.},

Starting from computer-aided designed data, components are built layer by layer within a powder bed by selectively melting the powder with a high power electron beam. In contrast to selective laser melting (SLM), which can be used for metals, polymers and ceramics, the application ﬁeld of the electron beam is restricted to metallic components since electric conductivity is required. On the other hand, the electron beam works under vacuum conditions, can be moved at extremely high velocities and a high beam power is available. These features make SEBM especially interesting for the processing of high-performance alloys.

For the SLM powder, the contrary situation was detected with better ﬂowability for the recycled powder. The reason for this could be referred to the powder layering process that results in a recycled powder with a decreased amount of ﬁner particles compared with the new powder.},

Meanwhile, the femtosecond laser can be combined with microlens arrays and interference lithography techniques to achieve the structures in submicron scales. Down to nanoscale feature sizes, advanced processing strategies, such as near-field scanning optical microscope, atomic force microscope, and microsphere, are applied in femtosecond laser processing and the minimum nanostructure creation has been pushed down to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde25 nm due to near-field effect. The most fascinating femtosecond laser precision engineering is the possibility of large-area, high-throughput, and far-field nanofabrication. In combination with special strategies, including dual femtosecond laser beam irradiation, {\textbackslash}textasciitilde15 nm nanostructuring can be achieved directly on silicon surfaces in far field and in ambient air.

	abstract = {Lightweight materials and structures have been extensively studied for a wide range of applications in design and manufacturing of more environment-friendly and more sustainable products, such as less materials and lower energy consumption, while maintaining proper mechanical and energy absorption characteristics. Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing techniques offer more freedom to realize some new designs of novel light­ weight materials and structures in an efficient way. However, the rational design for desired mechanical prop­ erties of these materials and structures remains a demanding topic. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent advances in additively manufactured materials and structures as well as their mechanical prop­ erties with an emphasis on energy absorption applications. First, the additive manufacturing techniques used for fabricating various materials and structures are briefly reviewed. Then, a variety of lightweight AM materials and structures are discussed, together with their mechanical properties and energy-absorption characteristics. Next, the AM-induced defects, their impacts on mechanical properties and energy absorption, as well as the methods for minimizing the effects are discussed. After that, numerical modeling approaches for AM materials and structures are outlined. Furthermore, design optimization techniques are reviewed, including parametric opti­ mization, topology optimization, and nondeterministic optimization with fabrication-induced uncertainties. Notably, data-driven and machine learning-based techniques exhibit compelling potential in design for additive manufacturing, process-property relations, and in-situ monitoring. Finally, significant challenges and future directions in this area are highlighted. This review is anticipated to provide a deep understanding of the state-ofthe-art additively manufactured materials and structures, aiming to improve the future design for desired me­ chanical properties and energy absorption.},

This review focuses on laser-metal-powder interactions, with an emphasis on powder-scale modelling and simulation, to elucidate the powder-part relationship. Through a comprehensive meta-analysis of the physical processes and the existing numerical modelling methodologies, this review exposes the advancements in both virtual powder bed generation and ways of carrying out multi-physics computations.

	abstract = {Despite continuous technological enhancements of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, the lack of process repeatability and stability still represents a barrier for the industrial breakthrough. The most relevant metal AM applications currently involve industrial sectors (e.g. aerospace and bio-medical) where defects avoidance is fundamental. Because of this, there is the need to develop novel in situ monitoring tools able to keep under control the stability of the process on a layer-by-layer basis, and to detect the onset of defects as soon as possible. On the one hand, AM systems must be equipped with in situ sensing devices able to measure relevant quantities during the process, a.k.a. process signatures. On the other hand, in-process data analytics and statistical monitoring techniques are required to detect and localize the defects in an automated way. This paper reviews the literature and the commercial tools for in situ monitoring of powder bed fusion (PBF) processes. It explores the different categories of defects and their main causes, the most relevant process signatures and the in situ sensing approaches proposed so far. Particular attention is devoted to the development of automated defect detection rules and the study of process control strategies, which represent two critical fields for the development of future smart PBF systems.},

Specific goals include discovering patterns related to defects and system performance issues, optimizing build configurations to avoid defects, and increasing production efficiency. We introduce Falcon, a new visual analytics system that allows users to interactively explore large, time-oriented data sets from multiple linked perspectives. Falcon provides overviews, detailed views, and unique segmented time series visualizations, all with adjustable scale options. To illustrate the effectiveness of Falcon at providing thorough and efficient knowledge discovery, we present a practical case study involving experts in additive manufacturing and data from a large-scale 3D printer.

Different authors pointed out that high-resolution imaging of each printed layer combined with image segmentation methods can be used to detect powder recoating errors together with surface and geometrical defects. The paper presents the first study aimed at characterizing the accuracy of insitu contour identification in LPBF layerwise images by means of a measurement system performance characterization. Different active contours segmentation methods are compared, and the sources of variability of the resulting measurements are investigated in terms of repeatability, part-to-part and build-to-build variability. The study also analyses and compares the sensitivity of in-situ measurements to different lighting conditions and laser scan directions. The results show that, by combining appropriate image pre-processing and segmentation algorithms with suitable lighting configurations, a high measurement repeatability can be achieved, i.e., a pure error that is up to one order of magnitude lower than the total measurement variability. This performance enables the detection of major geometric deviations and it paves the way to the design of statistical in-situ quality monitoring tools that rely on layerwise image segmentation.},

To overcome this deficit, the detection of backscattered electrons (BSEs) is a highly promising approach. A detection system for BSEs is used for recording the in operando signal during melting inside an EBM system. The acquired data are postprocessed by mapping the data points to spatial coordinates. A comparison between the obtained intensity map and the as-built surface shows a remarkable correlation, which might be suitable for process monitoring and quality control purposes.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) enables a fabrication freedom and is transforming the manner in which high-value and high-performance structures are created. The aerospace industry stands to benefit from structures in which the weight is minimized, the materials provide good mechanical properties at extreme temperatures, and a swarm of distinct parts can be consolidated into a single non-assembled complex structure. However, for additive manufactured parts to be used in flight-critical applications, the quality of the resulting fabricated parts must be well understood in light of the lack of flight heritage. As AM is performed layer-by-layer, new opportunities exist to monitor the fabrication in situ and non-destructively, and to provide a qualify-as-you-go paradigm. In this study, a high-resolution laser line scan profilometer is used just after a layer has been selectively melted, and the sensor is mounted to the recoater arm to provide unobtrusive and inexpensive access to the top of the powder bed. The driving hypothesis of the effort was that fused and unfused powder would lie at different elevations, as the fused powder volume would consolidate and therefore become depressed. Consequently, this measurement could both verify the intended geometry and identify any lack of fusion defects. Furthermore, some preliminary anecdotal evidence has shown that spatter can also be identified, and thus profilometry can inform the minimization of contamination (build chamber argon flow, build layout strategies, etc.).},

A particularly rapid prototyping technique of additive manufacturing is laser beam melting (LBM).

The process needs a tightly controlled atmosphere of inert gas, which requires a confined space of a building chamber. This and more process related factors like elevated temperatures, laser radiation or the resulting light intensity caused by the melting of metals, make a closed-loop quality control very ambitious.

As a result, they are directly responsible for the formation of flaws in the consolidated material, which cause quality and property variability in additive manufactured parts. Because of their small size and ubiquity across the powder bed, powder bed defects are difficult to detect and correct. In this work, we propose a new method to assess powder bed defects across the entire powder bed at the remarkable spatial resolution of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde5 μm. Our method relies on the integration of a contact image sensor taken from a flatbed document scanner to the powder re-coater module. Owing to the narrow depth-of-field of the sensor, we detect powder bed defects by identifying out-of-focus regions in the acquired scans using numerical image analysis techniques. Moreover, we show that we can assess the defects height (or depth) by quantifying the degree of “blurriness” in such regions. Our “powder bed scanner” is a rapid and cost-effective tool for in-line characterization of the powder bed quality. This technology may be instrumental to develop novel close loop strategies aimed at improving the consistency of additive manufactured parts.},

	abstract = {Electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique increasingly used by many industrial sectors, including medical and aerospace industries. The application of this technology is still, however, challenged by many technical barriers. One of the major issues is the lack of process monitoring and control system to monitor process repeatability and component quality reproducibility. Various techniques, mainly involving infrared (IR) and optical cameras, have been employed in previous attempts to study the quality of the EBAM process. However, all attempts lack the flexibility to zoom-in and focus on multiple regions of the processing area. In this paper, a digital electronic imaging system prototype and a piece of macroscopic process quality analysis software are presented. The prototype aims to provide flexibility in magnifications and the selection of fields of view (FOV). The software aims to monitor the EBAM process on a layer-by-layer basis. Digital electronic images were generated by detecting both secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE) originating from interactions between the machine electron beam and the processing area using specially designed hardware. Prototype capability experiments, software verification and demonstration were conducted at room temperature on the top layer of an EBAM test build. Digital images of different magnifications and FOVs were generated. The upper range of the magnification achieved in the experiments was 95 and the demonstration verified the potential ability of the software to be applied in process monitoring. It is believed that the prototype and software have significant potential to be used for in-process EBAM monitoring in many manufacturing sectors. This study is thought to be the necessary precursor for future work which will establish whether the concept is suited to working under in-process EBAM operating conditions.},

During the layer-by-layer building process, it can provide key information about geometry, roughness and it can even reveal typical defects such as lack-of-fusion porosity, gas pores or cracks. Usually, objects are built with varied processing parameters and then characterised post-mortem. In the present work, we describe our custom-designed additive manufacturing chamber allowing in situ 3D-non-destructive characterisation to be performed during layer-by-layer construction using synchrotron X-ray microtomography. Scans before (subsequently to powder deposition) and after local laser melting are acquired for every layer. A few examples of such a characterisation demonstrate the ability of the set-up to reproduce conditions close to those used in conventional laser powder-bed fusion devices and to reveal key phenomena.},

Previous efforts to monitor the PBF process in situ have been mostly limited to single tracks. The lack of quantitative, in situ monitoring results from full 3D PBF builds remains a barrier to closed-loop control. We track morphology in situ using coherent imaging, providing an immediate check on surface roughness, recoater blade damage, and powder packing density. Defects are corrected through manual closed-loop control; protrusions and depressions identified by in situ imaging are compensated through laser ablation and refilling, respectively, during a 3D build. Maximum surface roughness is reduced by 54\% and the number of layers with increased surface roughness relative to the steady-state value is reduced by 60\%. Manual closed-loop control, successfully achieved using coherent imaging of PBF layer morphology, is an important step towards full feedback control capabilities.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. This technology overcomes the geometrical limits of workpieces produced with the traditional subtractive methods and so gives the opportunity to manufacture highly complex shapes. Unfortunately, the repeatability of the manufacturing process and the monitoring of quality are not reliable enough to be utilized in mass production. The quality monitoring of AM processes in commercial equipment has been largely based on temperature measurements of the process zone or high-resolution imaging of the layers. However, both techniques lack information about the physical phenomena taking place in the depth of the materials medium and this limits their reliability in real-life applications. To overcome those restrictions, we propose to combine acoustic emission and reinforcement learning. The former captures the information about the subsurface dynamics of the process. The latter is a branch of machine learning that allows interpreting the received data in terms of quality. The combination of both is an original method for in situ and real-time quality monitoring. Acoustic data were collected during a real process using a commercial AM machine. The process parameters were selected to achieve three levels of quality in terms of porosity concentration while manufacturing a stainless steel 316L cuboid shape. Using our method, we demonstrated that each level of quality produced unique acoustic signatures during the build that were recognized by the classifier. The classification accuracy reached in this work proves that the proposed method has high potential to be used as in situ and real-time monitoring of AM quality.},

Through epipolar geometry, accurate measurements were calculated of the age, speed and direction of thousands of spatter events. Statistical analysis was performed focusing on spatter velocity with the driving hypothesis that velocity can be correlated to the weld quality and eventually leveraged in real-time process control.

The average volume fraction of the pores ({\textbackslash}textless0.2\%) was measured to be lower than that usually observed in competing processes, such as selective laser melting, but a strong relationship was found with the different beam strategies used to contour, and infill by hatching, a part section. The majority of pores were found to be small spherical gas pores, concentrated in the infill hatched region; this was attributed to the lower energy density and less focused beam used in the infill strategy allowing less opportunity for gas bubbles to escape the melt pool. Overall, increasing the energy density or focus of the beam was found to correlate strongly to a reduction in the level of gas porosity. Rarer irregular shaped pores were mostly located in the contour region and have been attributed to a lack of fusion between powder particles.},

	abstract = {The industrial breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing processes mainly involves highly regulated sectors, e.g., aerospace and healthcare, where both part and process qualification are of paramount importance. Because of this, there is an increasing interest for in-situ monitoring tools able to detect process defects and unstable states since their onset stage during the process itself. In-situ measured quantities can be regarded as “signatures” of the process behaviour and proxies of the final part quality. This study relies on the idea that the by-products of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can be used as process signatures to design and implement statistical monitoring methods. In particular, this paper proposes a methodology to monitor the LPBF process via in-situ infrared (IR) video imaging of the plume formed by material evaporation and heating of the surrounding gas. The aspect of the plume naturally changes from one frame to another following the natural dynamics of the process: this yields a multimodal pattern of the plume descriptors that limits the effectiveness of traditional statistical monitoring techniques. To cope with this, a nonparametric control charting scheme is proposed, called K-chart, which allows adapting the alarm threshold to the dynamically varying patterns of the monitored data. A real case study in LPBF of zinc powder is presented to demonstrate the capability of detecting the onset of unstable conditions in the presence of a material that, despite being particularly interesting for biomedical applications, imposes quality challenges in LPBF because of its low melting and boiling points. A comparison analysis is presented to highlight the benefits provided by the proposed approach against competitor methods.},

In this work, a detailed investigation into the balling behavior of selective laser melting of stainless steel and pure nickel powder was conducted. It was found that the SLM balling phenomenon can be divided into two types generally: the ellipsoidal balls with dimension of about 500 μm and the spherical balls with dimension of about 10 μm. The former is caused by worsened wetting ability and detrimental to SLM quality; the latter has no obvious detriment to SLM quality. The oxygen content plays an important role in determining the balling initiation, which can be considerably lessened by decreasing the oxygen content of atmosphere to 0.1\%. A high laser line energy density, which can be obtained by applying high laser power and low scan speed, could enable a well-wetting characteristic. The effect of scan interval on balling initiation is not obvious as long as the scan track is continuous. The surface remelting procedure can also alleviate the balling effect in a certain extent, due to the melting and wetting of metal balls.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to detect the onset of material cross-contamination in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) process using data from in situ sensors. Material cross-contamination refers to trace foreign materials that may be introduced in the powder feedstock used in the process due to reasons such as poor cleaning of the machine after previous builds or inadequate quality control during production and storage of the powder. Material cross-contamination may lead to deleterious changes in the microstructure of the AM part and consequently affect its functional properties. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to develop and apply a spectral graph theoretic approach to detect the occurrence of material cross-contamination in real-time as the part is being built using in-process sensors. The central hypothesis is that transforming the process signals in the spectral graph domain leads to early and more accurate detection of material cross-contamination in L-PBF compared to the traditional delay-embedded Bon-Jenkins stochastic time series analysis techniques, such as autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling. To test this hypothesis, Inconel alloy 625 (UNS alloy 06625) test parts were made at Edison Welding Institute (EWI) on a custom-built L-PBF apparatus integrated with multiple sensors, including a silicon photodetector (with 300 nm to 1100 nm optical wavelength). During the process, two types of foreign contaminant materials, namely, tungsten and aluminum particulates, under varying degrees of severity were introduced. To detect cross-contamination in the part, the photodetector sensor signatures were monitored hatch-by-hatch in the form of spectral graph transform coefficients. These spectral graph coefficients are subsequently tracked on a Hotelling T2 statistical control chart. Instances of Type II statistical error, i.e., probability of failing to detect the onset of material cross-contamination, were verified against X-ray computed tomography (XCT) scans of the part to be within 5\% in the case of aluminum contaminant particles. In contrast, traditional stochastic time series modeling approaches, e.g., ARMA, had corresponding Type II error exceeding 15\%. Furthermore, the computation time for the spectral graph approach was found to be less than one millisecond, compared to nearly 100 ms for the traditional time series models tested.},

	abstract = {The complex physical nature of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process warrants use of multiphysics computational simulations to predict or design optimal operating parameters or resultant part qualities such as microstructure or defect concentration. Many of these simulations rely on tuning based on characteristics of the laser-induced melt pool, such as the melt pool geometry (length, width, and depth). Additionally, many of numerous interacting variables that make the LPBF process so complex can be reduced and controlled by performing simple, single-track experiments on bare (no powder) substrates, yet still produce important and applicable physical results. The 2018 Additive Manufacturing Benchmark (AM Bench) tests and measurements were designed for this application. This paper describes the experiment design for the tests conducted using LPBF on bare metal surfaces, and the measurement results for the melt pool geometry and melt pool cooling rate performed on two LPBF systems. Several factors, such as accurate laser spot size, were determined after the 2018 AM Bench conference, with results of those additional tests reported here.},

	abstract = {The variances in local processing conditions during Selective Laser Melting (SLM), a powder bed Additive Manufacturing (AM) process, can cause defects that lead to part failure. The nature of SLM permits in-situ monitoring of radiometric signals emitted from the part surface during the process, including optical emission from excited alloying elements. Using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) to measure the spectral content of light emitted gives insight into the chemistry and relative intensities of excited species vaporized during SLM processing. The contribution from investigating the use of in-situ OES to gain information about local processing conditions during SLM is reported in this paper. A spectrometer is split into the SLM system laser beam path to measure visible light emitted from the melt pool and plume during the processing of 304L stainless steel. The inline conﬁguration allows signal collection regardless of the laser scan location. The spectroscopic information is correlated to the melt pool size and features of SLM samples for various build conditions (i.e., process parameters, build chamber atmosphere type, and pressure).The limitations that exist in OES implementation for certain build chamber conditions are discussed. The results in this paper are initial progress towards the use of OES in SLM part qualiﬁcation and controls applications.},
