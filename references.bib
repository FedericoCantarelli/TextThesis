	abstract = {Additive manufacturing of metals has emerged as a potential technology for companies to create highly integrated and individualized products. In particular, powder-based laser metal deposition has advantages such as flexibility and multimaterial capabilities. It is possible to mix powders and create alloys inside the melt-pool during the build process. Consequently, purpose made material combinations with set or even varying thermal properties can be realized. Inherently, the process becomes increasingly challenging because of the great number of variables. Analyzation of the manufactured part ensures top quality and detects errors and defects. To accomplish this, specimens have to be x-rayed or ground and cut into microsections. In order to save time and keep the parts’ integrity, a new method uses temperature data from the process to determine irregularities. During the additive manufacturing process, a 680 W diode laser melts the substrate and the powder locally. The powder is composed of 42\% nickel and 58\% iron. A pyrometer samples the temperature of the molten pool at a spectral range from 1.45 to 1.85 μm. The recorded data are mapped onto the toolpath of the process head. A script converts the time dependent signal to spatially resolved temperature points. The feedrate and the laser status aid to synchronize the data throughout. As a result, the overlaid melt-pool temperature visualizes the process and creates a tomography for the produced part. Initial experiments show that errors and defects like porosities and cavities are identifiable inside the manufactured structure. Furthermore, correlations between the visualization and errors detected with microsections are possible. Overall, this technique is an addition to the repertoire of data visualization and quality control in additive manufacturing and can be transferred to other machines and laser processes.},

	abstract = {Selective electron beam melting (SEBM) belongs to the additive manufacturing technologies which are believed to revolutionise future industrial production. Starting from computer-aided designed data, components are built layer by layer within a powder bed by selectively melting the powder with a high power electron beam. In contrast to selective laser melting (SLM), which can be used for metals, polymers and ceramics, the application ﬁeld of the electron beam is restricted to metallic components since electric conductivity is required. On the other hand, the electron beam works under vacuum conditions, can be moved at extremely high velocities and a high beam power is available. These features make SEBM especially interesting for the processing of high-performance alloys. The present review describes SEBM with special focus on the relationship between process characteristics, material consolidation and the resulting materials and component properties.},

	abstract = {The increasing interest towards additive manufacturing (AM) is pushing the industry to provide new solutions to improve process stability. Monitoring is a key tool for this purpose but the typical AM fast process dynamics and the high data ﬂow required to accurately describe the process are pushing the limits of standard statistical process monitoring (SPM) techniques. The adoption of novel smart data extraction and analysis methods are fundamental to monitor the process with the required accuracy while keeping the computational effort to a reasonable level for real-time application. In this work, a new framework for the detection of defects in metal additive manufacturing processes via in-situ high-speed cameras is presented: a new data extraction method is developed to efﬁciently extract only the relevant information from the regions of interest identiﬁed in the high-speed imaging data stream and to reduce the dimensionality of the anomaly detection task performed by three competitor machine learning classiﬁcation methods. The defect detection performance and computational speed of this approach is carefully evaluated through computer simulations and experimental studies, and directly compared with the performance and computational speed of other existing methods applied on the same reference dataset. The results show that the proposed method is capable of quickly detecting the occurrence of defects while keeping the high computational speed that would be required to implement this new process monitoring approach for real-time defect detection.},

	abstract = {With the increasing development of remote sensing platforms and the evolution of sampling facilities in mining and oil industry, spatial datasets are becoming increasingly large, inform a growing number of variables and cover wider and wider areas. Therefore, it is often necessary to split the domain of study to account for radically different behaviors of the natural phenomenon over the domain and to simplify the subsequent modeling step. The deﬁnition of these areas can be seen as a problem of unsupervised classiﬁcation, or clustering, where we try to divide the domain into homogeneous domains with respect to the values taken by the variables in hand. The application of classical clustering methods, designed for independent observations, does not ensure the spatial coherence of the resulting classes. Image segmentation methods, based on e.g. Markov random ﬁelds, are not adapted to irregularly sampled data. Other existing approaches, based on mixtures of Gaussian random functions estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm, are limited to reasonable sample sizes and a small number of variables. In this work, we propose two algorithms based on adaptations of classical algorithms to multivariate geostatistical data. Both algorithms are model free and can handle large volumes of multivariate, irregularly spaced data. The ﬁrst one proceeds by agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The spatial coherence is ensured by a proximity condition imposed for two clusters to merge. This proximity condition relies on a graph organizing the data in the coordinates space. The hierarchical algorithm can then be seen as a graph-partitioning algorithm. Following this interpretation, a spatial version of the spectral clustering algorithm is also proposed. The performances of both algorithms are assessed on toy examples and a mining dataset.},

The initial cluster centers are effectively selected from those points which lie on the boundary of higher radius Voronoi circles. As a result, the proposed method automates the selection of the initial cluster centers to supply them for K-means. The proposed method is experimented on various artificial (hand-made) as well as real world data sets of various dimensions.

	abstract = {In many modern applications, including analysis of gene expression and text documents, the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and unordered--with no particular meaning to the given order of the variables. Yet, successful learning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that the data are typically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only a few features. In this paper we present treelets--a novel construction of multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth signals. The method is fully adaptive, as it returns a hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis which both reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are especially well-suited as a dimensionality reduction and feature selection tool prior to regression and classification, in situations where sample sizes are small and the data are sparse with unknown groupings of correlated or collinear variables. The method is also simple to implement and analyze theoretically. Here we describe a variety of situations where treelets perform better than principal component analysis, as well as some common variable selection and cluster averaging schemes. We illustrate treelets on a blocked covariance model and on several data sets (hyperspectral image data, DNA microarray data, and internet advertisements) with highly complex dependencies between variables.},

            The powder bed fusion-based additive manufacturing process uses a laser to melt and fuse powder metal material together and creates parts with intricate surface topography that are often influenced by laser path, layer-to-layer scanning strategies, and energy density. Surface topography investigations of as-built, nickel alloy (625) surfaces were performed by obtaining areal height maps using focus variation microscopy for samples produced at various energy density settings and two different scan strategies. Surface areal height maps and measured surface texture parameters revealed the highly irregular nature of surface topography created by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Effects of process parameters and energy density on the areal surface texture have been identified. Machine learning methods were applied to measured data to establish input and output relationships between process parameters and measured surface texture parameters with predictive capabilities. The advantages of utilizing such predictive models for process planning purposes are highlighted.},

When processing the fresh, as-received powder in a wellcontrolled environment, the oxide inclusions contained in the precursor powder were the primary contributors to the formation of nano-scale oxides in the ﬁnal additive manufactured (AM) product. These oxide inclusions were found to be enriched with oxygen getter elements like Si and Mn. By controlling the extraneous oxygen level in the process environment, the oxygen level in AM produced parts was found to increase with the extraneous oxygen level. The intrusion pathway of this extra oxygen was found to be dominated by the incorporation of spatter particles into the build during processing. Moisture induced oxidation during powder storage was also found to result in a higher oxide density in the AM produced parts. SS 316L powder free of Si and Mn oxygen getters was processed in a well-controlled environment and resulted in a similar level of oxygen intrusion. Microhardness testing indicated that the oxide volume fraction increase from extraneous oxygen did not inﬂuence hardness values. However, a marked decrease in hardness was found for the humidiﬁed and Si-Mn free AM processed parts.},

	abstract = {Rapidly solidified rare-earth-based permanent magnets are considered to have better potential as permanent magnets compared to the conventional bulk materials, which can be attributed to their improved microstructure and better magnetic properties compared to rare-earth magnets synthesized by the conventional (powder metallurgy) routes. The performance (quality) of these magnets depends on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the different processing routes, such as atomization, melt spinning, and melt extraction. Here, we review the various processing routes of rapidly solidified rare-earth permanent magnets and the related properties and applications. In the review, some specific alloy systems, such as Sm–Co-based alloys, Nd–Fe–B, and interstitially modified Fe-rich rare-earth magnets are discussed in detail mentioning their processing routes and subsequently achieved crystal structure, microstructure and magnetic properties, and the related scopes for various applications. Some newly developed nanocomposites and thin-film magnets are also included in the discussion.},

Even though this is a generally accepted fact, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the powder property–part property relationship. However, numerous investigations focusing on selected powder properties and their corresponding influence on process aspects or final part properties have been published in recent years. Still, generalized statements on powder requirements for a defined process performance are not available. This can be attributed to the fact that the community has not yet come to an agreement which characterization techniques are most suitable for powder characterization in the additive manufacturing context and in most cases only selected aspects have been investigated for special powder materials. The aim of this review is to assess these building blocks of knowledge and to provide an overview on the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {Cellular materials such as honeycombs and lattices are an important area of research in Additive Manufacturing due to their ability to improve functionality and performance. While there are several design choices when selecting a unit cell, it is not always apparent what the optimum cellular design for a particular application is. This becomes particularly challenging when seeking an optimal design for more than one function, or when the design needs to transition spatially between different functions. Nature abounds with examples of cellular materials that are able to achieve multifunctionality, but designers lack the ability to translate the underlying principles in these examples to their design tools. In this work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between nature and designer. We present a classification of natural cellular materials based on their structure and function, and relate them in a manner amenable for use in guiding design for Additive Manufacturing.},

Through control of various parameters lattice structures can produce unique mechanical, electrical, thermal and acoustic properties, and have received much research attention. Despite the increasing volume of published data on the mechanical response of speciﬁc SLM lattice structures, there exists no overarching analysis. This work addresses this identiﬁed deﬁciency by providing a comprehensive summary of the experimental data reported on the mechanical response of SLM lattice structures. The design, fabrication and performance of SLM lattice structures are reviewed and the quality of data reported is analysed to inform best-practice for future studies. This comprehensive data summary enables meta-analysis of the reported mechanical performance of SLM lattice structures, providing insight into the bounds of their technical capabilities. Correlations were identiﬁed between the relative density and mechanical properties of many unit cell topologies consistent with the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby model, indicating its usefulness in describing and predicting the behaviour of SLM lattice structures. This review provides designers with a compiled resource of experimental data and design for AM tools to inform future design applications of SLM lattice structures and facilitates their further commercial adoption.},

It is an emerging horizon that looks to the natural world for ideas and inspiration for all kinds of design opportunities. In the search of sustainable building design and technology Biomimicry is an alternative solution. The inspiration from nature is driving force in architecture, resulting in majestic works of architecture. Biomimicry is about solution refined and developed by nature. These principles help designers to create products, processes, and policies that are well adapted to life on earth in its long run. Sometimes human designed solutions are cruder and more additive than the nature‘s solutions of the same problem. As we seek new ways to design and live sustainably, and in many cases have solved the same problems with a far greater economy of means. It is a design principle seeking sustainable solutions to divert attention towards nature‘s solution for human problems by consulting and emulating nature‘s tested and tried patterns and strategies. The primary idea is that necessity requires nature to be imaginative. Through this imagination, nature has successfully solved many of the problems that designers today are still struggling to solve. The behavioral and operational systems of the nature have a lot to teach and inspire us, provided we as architects and designers open our eyes towards it. The core idea is that nature already has all the remedies hidden in its deepest sanctuaries, we just have to be insolent and find it. Nature‘s consummate engineers – flora and fauna, have held in themselves the secret of survival. Aim is revealing how radical increase in resource efficiency can be achieved by looking to the nature for inspiration. For any sustainable building design, structural efficiency, water efficiency, zero-waste systems, thermal environment, and energy efficiency, Biomimicry is all about deriving solutions from nature.},

	abstract = {Micro computed tomography (microCT) allows non-destructive insights into the quality of additively manufactured parts and the processes that produce them. MicroCT has been used widely in this industry but the use of this technique is often time consuming and costly which reduces its potential impact and the beneﬁts associated with its use. By using standardized test procedures, the analysis time and cost can be minimized and conﬁdence in obtained results increased. A round robin test was conducted as follows: a series of standard test procedures (part sizes and shapes and test protocols) were applied – using one microCT system – to identical parts produced on a variety of metal additive manufacturing systems (speciﬁcally laser powder bed fusion systems). These are simple parts: a 10 mm cube, a 15 mm diameter vertical-built cylinder and a basic topology optimized example part – a bracket. The 15 mm diameter cylinder acts as witness specimen for the build of the complex part. All these were produced in Ti6Al4V, and in some cases parts were provided with variations in process parameters or manufacturing conditions which led to diﬀerent types of intentional manufacturing ﬂaws or defects. Various intentional and unintentional ﬂaws were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. The major result shown is that the analysis of a simple 10 mm cube clearly identiﬁes incorrect process parameters even for very low levels of porosity, with unique porosity distributions and characteristics. It is found that generally this porosity extends to larger, more complex parts. The witness specimen (15 mm cylinder) allows clear identiﬁcation of layered stop-start ﬂaws, at a resolution better than a complex part built alongside it, allowing to identify defective builds. The results indicate a successful ﬁrst step at standardized microCT analysis procedures for improvement of processes and quality control in additive manufacturing.},

A manual data analysis method is given, and the events indicated by the analysis (DMP-meltpool events) are shown to correlate to the static tensile properties of the samples built. These events indicate the probability of material discontinuities (defects) in the metal additive manufacturing (AM) parts. In order to do so, cylindrical bars of Ti-6Al-4V ELI were built and monitored using DMP-meltpool. The tensile properties of the printed cylinders were correlated with the events detected by DMP-meltpool. An inverse relation between plastic elongation and the DMP-meltpool event density was observed. These results show that DMPmeltpool can be used to predict the quality of AM parts by detecting variations in the signals and tagging these events throughout the build as defects. Thus the technique can be employed for ﬁrst stage in-line quality control of AM parts and for sorting out parts with potential defects non-destructively. The DMP-meltpool events could have signiﬁcant correlations with other mechanical properties (like fatigue, hardness, fracture toughness, and crack propagation) since such properties are inﬂuenced by defects originating from the process instabilities.},

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to designing cellular materials, borrowing concepts of symmetry from mathematics and the arts to manipulate 2dimensional square honeycombs of uniform thickness, starting from a regular, periodic square, gradually varying symmetry and the number of shapes to create a range of forms. We report results of compression testing of specimens made with the Fused Deposition Modeling process, and study the effective specific properties of the honeycombs with regard to their peak stress at failure, densification strain and energy absorption. We report weak to no correlation to the first two of these, but demonstrate how asymmetry and negative space may be leveraged to formulate design principles for energy absorption.},

However, minimal surface designs in this density range are shown to have very thin walls, potentially making their accurate production more challenging, or more suitable for applications where larger pore sizes and sheet thicknesses may be applicable. Interesting results such as dual pore size distributions and variations in tortuosity of pore networks are demonstrated, with diﬀerences between various designs.

            The capabilities of metal additive manufacturing (AM) are evolving rapidly thanks to both increasing industry demand and improved scientific understanding of the process. This article provides an overview of AM of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, which has essentially been used as a yardstick to gauge the capability of each metal AM process developed to date. It begins by summarizing the metal AM processes existing today. This is followed by a discussion of the macro- and microstructural characteristics, defects, and tensile and fatigue properties of AM Ti-6Al-4V by selective laser melting, laser metal deposition (both powder and wire), and selective electron-beam melting compared to non-AM Ti-6Al-4V. The tensile and fatigue properties of as-built AM Ti-6Al-4V (with machined or polished surfaces) can be made comparable, or even superior, to those of Ti-6Al-4V in the most commonly used mill-annealed condition. However, these properties can exhibit a large degree of scatter and are often anisotropic, affected by AM build orientations. Post-AM surface treatments or both the post-AM surface and heat treatments are necessary to ensure the minimum required properties and performance consistency. Future directions to further unlock the potential of AM of Ti-6Al-4V for superior and consistent mechanical properties are also discussed.},

This can be achieved with cellular materials, such as honeycombs, foams and lattices. Designing structures with cellular materials involves answering an important question: What is the optimum unit cell for the application of interest? There is currently no classiﬁcation framework that describes the spectrum of cellular materials, and no methodology to guide the designer in selecting among the inﬁnite list of possibilities. In this paper, we ﬁrst review traditional engineering methods currently in use for selecting cellular materials in design. We then develop a classiﬁcation scheme for the different types of cellular materials, dividing them into three levels of design decisions: tessellation, element type and connectivity. We demonstrate how a biomimetic approach helps a designer make decisions at all three levels. The scope of this paper is limited to the structural domain, but the methodology developed here can be extended to the design of components in thermal, ﬂuid, optical and other areas. A deeper purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how traditional methods in design can be combined with a biomimetic approach.},

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) modality that was used in this work is powder bed laser based fusion. The case studies correspond to the redesign and manufacture of two heritage parts for a Surrey Satellite Technology LTD (SSTL) Technology Demonstrator Space Mission that are currently functioning in orbit (case studies 1 and 2), and a system of ﬁve components for the SpaceIL’s lunar launch vehicle planned for launch in the near future (case study 3). In each case, the nominal or heritage part has undergone topology optimization, incorporating the AM manufacturing constraints that include: minimization of support structures, ability to remove unsintered powder, and minimization of heat transfer jumps that will cause artifact warpage. To this end the topology optimization exercise must be coupled to the Additive Manufacturing build direction, and steps are incorporated to integrate the AM constraints. After design veriﬁcation by successfully passing a Finite Element Analysis routine, the components have been fabricated and the AM artifacts and in-process testing coupons have undergone veriﬁcation and qualiﬁcation testing in order to deliver structural components that are suitable for their respective missions.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing-oriented topology optimization has been extensively studied the past two decades, in particular for the conventional manufacturing methods, for example, machining and injection molding or casting. Both design and manufacturing engineers have benefited from these efforts because of the close-to-optimal and friendly-to-manufacture design solutions. Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) has received significant attention from both academia and industry. AM is characterized by producing geometrically complex components layer-by-layer, and greatly reduces the geometric complexity restrictions imposed on topology optimization by conventional manufacturing. In other words, AM can make near-full use of the freeform structural evolution of topology optimization. Even so, new rules and restrictions emerge due to the diverse and intricate AM processes, which should be carefully addressed when developing the AM-specific topology optimization algorithms. Therefore, the motivation of this perspective paper is to summarize the state-of-art topology optimization methods for a variety of AM topics. At the same time, this paper also expresses the authors’ perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in these topics. The hope is to inspire both researchers and engineers to meet these challenges with innovative solutions.},

	abstract = {Hollow-walled lattices are a recent optimization upon the conventional dense-walled lattice design. These novel microstructures can achieve extremely low densities while exhibiting robust technical properties including high ductility, strength, and stiffness. However, the current fabrication process for these structures is ineffective, requiring multiple additive and subtractive manufacturing processes to produce a single specimen. The appli­ cation of a single step additive manufacturing (AM) method has not yet been evaluated for hollow-walled lattice fabrication. This study aims to assess the viability of such a method, enabling greater geometric control, and providing a single process to reduce both time and cost. The manufacturability of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) will be explored through Ti6Al4V hollow-walled struts and lattices at varying diameters, lengths, and inclination angles while retaining a constant wall thickness. Quasi static compressional testing will also occur upon the hollow-walled body-centered cubic lattices with a reinforced strut in the Z-axis (BCCZ). These experimental BCCZ lattices have been fabricated at relative densities ranging from 5 to 40\%, and strength and modulus values have been observed between 4 and 25 MPa, and 750–3640 MPa, respectively. The resultant data will assist in the generation of the Gibson-Ashby Model to systematically compare LPBF Ti6Al4V hollow-walled lattices to re­ ported dense-walled lattices. This study presents an exploration into the single-step fabrication of metal hollowwalled struts and lattices to broaden the scope of manufacturability and facilitate future advancements.},

	abstract = {Honeycomb structures have a wide range of applications, from medical implants to industrial components. In addition, honeycombs play a critical role when passive protection is required due to their low density and high energy absorption capabilities. With the transition of additive manufacturing from a rapid prototyping approach to a manufacturing process, this technology has recently offered designers and manufacturers the ability to fabricate and modify lattice structures such as honeycombs. The current study presents the application of laser powder bed fusion, a common additive manufacturing process for producing industrial metal components, for fabricating metal honeycombs. In addition, this study examines three modified designs that can only be practically fabricated using additive manufacturing and compares them with conventional honeycombs. For this purpose, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the honeycomb structures. The results show that the structures produced by additive manufacturing have acceptable performance compared to conventional honeycomb structures, and laser powder bed fusion can be considered to be a reliable manufacturing method for honeycomb production. Furthermore, the honeycombs produced according to the modified designs generally outperformed their counterparts made from the typical hexagonal cells. Ultimately, the use of triangular cells as a design modification is proposed to produce honeycombs with promising performance characteristics in all of their principal axes and under various pressure scenarios, from quasi-static to dynamic loading rates. Finally, this study also investigates the applicability of a newly developed maraging steel for additive manufacturing of honeycombs. Microstructural analysis and quasi-static tensile tests have confirmed the material properties for this purpose.},

	abstract = {There are three primary aspects to the economics of additive manufacturing: measuring the value of goods produced, measuring the costs and benefits of using the technology, and estimating the adoption and diffusion of the technology. This paper provides an updated estimate of the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on additive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the literature where this technology is cost effective. The paper then goes on to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal costs and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and a resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends in the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an estimated \$667 million in value added produced using additive manufacturing, which equates to 0.01 \% of total global manufacturing value added. US value added is estimated as \$241 million. Current research on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is cost effective for manufacturing small batches with continued centralized production; however, with increased automation distributed production may become cost effective. Due to the complexities of measuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current studies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine the production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend not to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation costs along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive manufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant portion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are declining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have resulted in this technology representing 0.02 \% of the relevant manufacturing industries in the US; however, as the costs of additive manufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely adopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer interactions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing reveals that for this technology to exceed \$4.4 billion in 2020, \$16.0 billion in 2025, and \$196.8 billion in 2035 it would need to deviate from its current trends of adoption.},

The lack of tooling makes RM economically suitable for low and medium production volumes. A comparison with traditional manufacturing processes is important; in particular, cost comparison. Cost is usually the key point for decision making, with break-even points for different manufacturing technologies being the dominant information for decision makers. Cost models used for traditional production methodologies focus on material and labour costs, while modern automated manufacturing processes need cost models that are able to consider the high impact of investments and overheads. Previous work on laser sintering costing was developed in 2003. This current work presents advances and discussions on the limits of the previous work through direct comparison. A new cost model for laser sintering is then proposed. The model leads to graph profiles that are typical for layer-manufacturing processes. The evolution of cost models and the indirect cost significance in modern costing representation is shown finally.},

	abstract = {This review article summarizes the current state-of-the-art for biomimicry in additive manufacturing. Biomimicry is the practice of learning from and emulating nature - which can be increasingly realized in engineering applications due to progress in additive manufacturing (AM). AM has grown tremendously in recent years, with improvements in technology and resulting material properties sometimes exceeding those of equivalent parts produced by traditional production processes. This has led to the industrial use of AM parts even in highly critical applications, most notably in aerospace, automotive and medical applications. The ability to create parts with complex geometries is one of the most important advantages of this technology, allowing the production of complex functional objects from various materials including plastics and metals that cannot be easily produced by any other means. Utilizing the full complexity allowed by AM is the key to unlocking the huge potential of this technology for real world applications – and biomimicry might be pivotal in this regard. Biomimicry may take different forms in AM, including customization of parts for individuals (e.g. medical prosthesis, implants or custom sports equipment), or optimization for specific properties such as stiffness and light-weighting (e.g. lightweight parts in aerospace or automotive applications). The optimization process often uses an iterative simulation-driven process analogous to biological evolution – with an improvement in every iteration. Other forms of biomimicry in AM include the incorporation of real biological inputs into designs (i.e. emulating nature for its unique properties); the use of cellular or lattice structures – for various applications and customized to the application; incorporating multi-functionality into designs; the consolidation of numerous parts into one and the reduction of waste, amongst others. Numerous biomimetic design approaches may be used – broadly categorized into customized/freeform, simulation-driven and lattice designs. All these approaches may be used in combination with one another, and in all cases with or without direct input from nature. The aim of this review is to unravel the different forms of biomimetic engineering that are now possible – focusing mainly on functional mechanical engineering for end-use parts, i.e. not for prototyping. The current limits of each design approach are discussed and the most exciting future opportunities for biomimetic AM applications are highlighted.},

The advantage of Optimal Control over Global Minimization such as in [16] is that it can handle both approximation and interpolation. Moreover a cost function is introduced to implement a design objective (shortest curve, smoothest one etc...). The present work introduces the Optimal Control over the knot vectors of non-uniform B-Splines. Violation of Schoenberg-Whitney condition is dealt naturally within the Optimal Control framework. A geometric description of the resulting null space is provided as well.},

It is a nonparametric statistical method that does not rely on distributional or dependency structure assumptions. The method is motivated by and applied to varved (annually laminated) sediment data from lake Kassjo¨n in northern Sweden, aiming to infer on past environmental and climate changes. The resulting clusters and their time dynamics show great potential for seasonal climate interpretation, in particular for winter climate changes.},

However, an automated and robust detection of unstable process conditions represents a key capability to meet challenging qualiﬁcation requirements imposed by industry. This study presents novel in-situ monitoring methods based on high spatial resolution imaging for powder bed homogeneity monitoring and high temporal resolution video-imaging for hot-spot detection, i.e., the detection of anomalous local heat accumulations.},

	abstract = {The production of novel types of complex shapes is nowadays enabled by new manufacturing paradigms such as additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing. The continuous increase of shape complexity imposes new challenges in terms of inspection, product qualification and process monitoring methodologies. Previously proposed methods for 2.5D freeform surfaces are no longer applicable in the presence of this kind of new full 3D geometries. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by presenting a statistical quality monitoring approach for structures that cannot be described in terms of parametric models. The goal consists of identifying out-of-control geometrical distortions by analyzing either local variations within the part or changes from part to part. The proposed approach involves an innovative solution for modeling the deviation between the nominal geometry (the originating 3D model) and the real geometry (measured via x-ray computed tomography) by slicing the shapes and estimating the deviation slice by slice. 3D deviation maps are then transformed into 1D deviation profiles enabling the use of a profile monitoring scheme for local defect detection. The feasibility and potential of this method are demonstrated by focusing on a category of complex shapes where an elemental geometry regularly repeats in space. These shapes are known as lattice structures, or metamaterials, and their trabecular shape is thought to provide innovative mechanical and functional performance. The performance of the proposed method is shown in real and simulated case studies.},

However, their several beneﬁts can be adversely affected by local defects and geometrical deviations, which can be hardly identiﬁed via ex-situ metrology. This paper is the ﬁrst to prove that lattice structure inspection can be implemented in-situ, tackling the uncertainty of in-process imaging. The method combines powder bed image segmentation with robust statistical modelling to translate the in-line 3D geometry reconstruction into a 1D representation of unit cell’s properties. Results demonstrate the agreement between in-situ modelling and ex-situ ground-truth inspections.},
