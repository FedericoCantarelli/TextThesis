	abstract = {Lightweight materials and structures have been extensively studied for a wide range of applications in design and manufacturing of more environment-friendly and more sustainable products, such as less materials and lower energy consumption, while maintaining proper mechanical and energy absorption characteristics. Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing techniques offer more freedom to realize some new designs of novel light­ weight materials and structures in an efficient way. However, the rational design for desired mechanical prop­ erties of these materials and structures remains a demanding topic. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent advances in additively manufactured materials and structures as well as their mechanical prop­ erties with an emphasis on energy absorption applications. First, the additive manufacturing techniques used for fabricating various materials and structures are briefly reviewed. Then, a variety of lightweight AM materials and structures are discussed, together with their mechanical properties and energy-absorption characteristics. Next, the AM-induced defects, their impacts on mechanical properties and energy absorption, as well as the methods for minimizing the effects are discussed. After that, numerical modeling approaches for AM materials and structures are outlined. Furthermore, design optimization techniques are reviewed, including parametric opti­ mization, topology optimization, and nondeterministic optimization with fabrication-induced uncertainties. Notably, data-driven and machine learning-based techniques exhibit compelling potential in design for additive manufacturing, process-property relations, and in-situ monitoring. Finally, significant challenges and future directions in this area are highlighted. This review is anticipated to provide a deep understanding of the state-ofthe-art additively manufactured materials and structures, aiming to improve the future design for desired me­ chanical properties and energy absorption.},

However, variation in the performance of techniques is creating a major quagmire for the researchers. In many cases, some methods have shown similar results while in some cases one outperformed another. Choosing the best and suitable technique for process modelling and optimization is still a challenging task for the researchers. Hence, to present a direction for the prospect investigators, in this study, the performance of different machine learning techniques applied in the manufacturing sector is reviewed by assessing many articles from the past two decades. Among several machine learning techniques reviewed in this study, application of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) in process modelling and optimization has become quite noticeable because of its ability to predict the output quickly and accurately. The effectiveness and practicality of ANN models in manufacturing applications are reviewed for demonstrating its pivotal role in process modeling. Observations are reported in the study.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes have proven to be a perfect match for topology optimi­ zation (TO), as they are able to realize sophisticated geometries in a unique layer-by-layer manner. From a manufacturing viewpoint, however, there is a significant likelihood of processrelated defects within complex geometrical features designed by TO. This is because TO sel­ domly accounts for process constraints and conditions and is typically perceived as a purely geometrical design tool. On the other hand, advanced AM process simulations have shown their potential as reliable tools capable of predicting various process-related conditions and defects. Thus far, geometry design by topology optimization and multiphysics manufacturing simulations have been viewed as two mostly separate paradigms, whereas one should really conceive them as one holistic computational design tool. More specifically, AM process models provide input to physics-based TO, where consequently, not only the designed component will function optimally, but also will have near-to-minimum manufacturing defects. In this regard, we aim at giving a thorough overview of holistic computational design tool concepts applied within AM. First, literature on TO for performance optimization is reviewed and then the most recent developments within physics-based TO techniques related to AM are covered. Process simulations play a pivotal role in the latter type of TO and serve as additional constraints on top of the primary end-user optimization objectives. As a natural consequence of this, a comprehensive and detailed review of non-metallic and metallic additive manufacturing simulations is performed, where the latter is divided into micro-scale and deposition-scale simulations. Material multi-scaling techniques, which are central to the process-structure-property relationships, are reviewed next, followed by a subsection on process multi-scaling techniques, which are reduced-order versions of advanced process models and are incorporable into physics-based TO due to their lower computational requirements. Finally the paper is concluded and suggestions for further research paths discussed.},

This study was focused on 4340 steel fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), and 42 laser power and scan speed combinations have been systematically investigated to optimize the melt pool geometry and ensure fully dense parts. The AM material was compared with a wrought 4340 equivalent and studied in both as-fabricated and heat-treated conditions. Two heat treatments were designed and used to optimize the materials for strength and toughness, respectively. Microstructure, tensile, and fractographic studies were conducted to assess build integrity and establish processing–structure–performance relationships. Tensile properties of the AM materials in all studied conditions were equivalent or better than the comparable wrought materials. The high performance of the AM materials was attributed to the absence of both manganese sulﬁde inclusions and rolling-induced banding, typically found in the wrought materials. The ﬁne cellular substructure is thought to additionally contribute to the high strength of the as-fabricated AM material. Complementary to the knowledge that has emerged from the experimental investigations, the dataset was further leveraged to make recommendations for future design of experiments to optimize AM build parameters in other material systems. A statistical Monte Carlo analysis was used to predict the interpolation error produced when using reduced datasets and to enable informed processing parameters selection. These ﬁndings are discussed to make recommendations for the use of AM materials for high-integrity structural applications.},

Aviation industry is one such sector that additive manufacturing brought about major transformations. Wire arc additive manufacturing plays an important role in aviation companies to reduce carbon emissions, increase efficiency and allow tailor-made components. However, there are some technical challenges such as microstructural porosity and voids that need to be addressed before they go into full-fledge adoption. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a key role in porosity detection. However, applicability of AI for porosity detection is limited due to the difficulties in collecting large amounts of data. The present article demonstrates machine learning models for porosity detection in microstructural images of wire-arc additively manufactured aluminium alloy 6061 parts with limited dataset. Segmentation of pores from microstructures is performed based on pixel-level color and texture features obtained by using Gabor filters. The machine learning models, whose hyperparameters are chosen from cross-validation, achieved an average classification accuracy of 98.89 \% (random forest) for porosity detection with pores above the size of 5 μm. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are very effective when compared to the recently proposed methods in the literature.},

	abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are novel and futuristic materials, which possess extraordinary mechanical, physical, and chemical properties incomparable to traditional alloys. Nowadays, these alloys exhibit great potential for industrial applications due to the developments of ultra-superior HEAs. Due to the certain inherent limitations in the conventional processing routes of HEAs, the additive manufacturing (AM) of these alloys has been rapidly emerging in recent years. Laser-aided additive manufacturing (LAAM) of HEAs, through selective laser melting (SLM) and direct laser deposition (DLD), is expediting a renaissance in the material science field, with the prime focus on the fabrication of highly complex HEA parts with tailorable microstructures and mechanical properties. The review provides critical and in-depth details of laser-based technologies vastly applied for printing HEA products. Powder processing routes affect particle morphologies and the distribution of particle size. Addition­ ally, the elemental composition of additively manufactured (AM-ed) HEAs plays an important role in the me­ chanical characteristics of 3D-printed parts. Furthermore, post-processing strategies help in mitigating residual stresses and other HEA defects. Compared to conventional manufacturing routes, HEAs printed through SLM and DLD technologies exhibited better mechanical characteristics due to rapid cooling rates. It is anticipated that AMed HEAs will be practically applied to manufacture large-scale and complex 3D industrial products, which will ultimately help in developing 3D-printed HEAs for industries.},

	abstract = {Laser additive manufacturing (AM) is an advanced green shaping technology that enables fast and ﬂexible fabrication or repair of high-performance metallic materials. Since the component with the complex structure can be directly shaped by AM technologies, and then it can not only achieve the increase of the production efﬁciency of the AM component, but also the reduction of the component weight. Therefore, AM technologies are extensively used in the aerospace and automotive industries. Moreover, since AM components are usually in service under the conditions of static or complex dynamic cyclic loading, the fatigue performance of AM components is a key consideration during the service process. However, during the additive manufacturing process, the intrinsic AM defects such as lack of fusion (LOF) and unmelted particles will inevitably be formed, causing the stress concentration in the local area of the AM component, thus deteriorating the fatigue performance of the AM component. At the same time, since the defects in AM component can be reduced by the post-treatments or heat treatments but may not be fully eliminated, and therefore, the presence of the intrinsic AM defects tends to lead to unstable fatigue properties of the AM components compared with the components prepared by conventional manufacturing technologies. This work mainly reviews the latest research progress in improving the fatigue properties of superalloys manufactured by laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) and laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) techniques. The research results of AM titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and iron-based alloys in this ﬁeld are highlighted, and the low-cycle fatigue, high-cycle fatigue behaviors and fatigue crack propagation processes of these alloys under multi-ﬁeld coupling and general testing conditions are compared and reviewed. In addition, this review also analyzes the effects of defects, microstructures, and printing processes, post-treatments, and heat treatments on the fatigue properties of the AM superalloys, and also introduces the relevant fatigue mechanical models, and provides an outlook for important future development directions in this research ﬁeld.},

Nondestructive Testing is widely applied, and particularly in additive manufacturing, to ensure efficient quality control and preventive/predictive maintenance without changing the characteristics and initial state of the material. Each Nondestructive Testing technique is based on different physical principles; therefore, the selection and correct use of each technique depends on the application, the manufacturing process, the type of material and the possible discontinuities, among many others.

The main characteristics of the processes are analyzed, highlighting the most relevant works and the challenges that each technique should face.

We analyze the influence of the manufacturing process, material microstructure and detection parameters on ultrasonic testing and summarize the application of ultrasonic testing for offline and online detection of defects in metallic AM components. On this basis, the application and advantages of phased array ultrasonic testing, laser-generated ultrasonic testing and hybrid nondestructive testing detection are discussed.

Accurate detection, characterization, and prediction of these defects and anomalies have an important and immediate impact in manufacturing fullydense and defect-free builds. This review seeks to elucidate common defects/anomalies and their formation mechanisms in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes. They could arise from raw materials, processing conditions, and post-processing. While defects/anomalies in laser welding have been studied exten­ sively, their formation and evolution remain unclear. Additionally, the existence of powder in powder bed fusion techniques may generate new types of defects, e.g., porosity transferring from powder to builds. Practical strategies to mitigate defects are also addressed through fundamental understanding of their formation. Such explorations enable the validation and calibration of models and ease the process qualification without costly trial-and-error experimentation.},

Quality data formats are evolving from simple univariate or multivariate characteristics to big data streams consisting of sequences of images and videos in the visible or infrared range; manufacturing processes are moving from series production to more and more customized applications. In this framework, novel methods are needed to monitor and keep under statistical control the process. This study presents two novel process monitoring techniques that rely on the partial first order stochastic dominance (PFOSD) concept, applicable to in-line analysis of video image data aiming at signaling out-of-control process states. Being non-parametric, they allow dealing with complex underlying dynamics and wildly varying distributions that represent the natural process conditions. A motivating case study in metal additive manufacturing is presented, where the proposed methodology enables the in-line and in-situ detection of anomalous patterns in thermal videos captured during the production of zinc samples.

	abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) has been widely used in the fields of aviation, aerospace and die manufacturing due to its ability to produce metal components with arbitrarily complex shapes. However, the instability of SLM process often leads to quality fluctuation of the formed component, which hinders the further development and application of SLM. In situ quality control during SLM process is an effective solution to the quality fluctuation of formed components. However, the basic premise of feedback control during SLM process is the rapid and accurate diagnosis of the quality. Therefore, an in situ monitoring method of SLM process, which provides quality diagnosis information for feedback control, became one of the research hotspots in this field in recent years. In this paper, the research progress of in situ monitoring during SLM process based on images is reviewed. Firstly, the significance of in situ monitoring during SLM process is analyzed. Then, the image information source of SLM process, the image acquisition systems for different detection objects (the molten pool region, the scanned layer and the powder spread layer) and the methods of the image information analysis, detection and recognition are reviewed and analyzed. Through review and analysis, it is found that the existing image analysis and detection methods during SLM process are mainly based on traditional image processing methods combined with traditional machine learning models. Finally, the main development direction of in situ monitoring during SLM process is proposed by combining with the frontier technology of image-based computer vision.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is an important enabling technology for intelligent manufacturing. The DLbased industrial image pattern recognition (DLBIIPR) plays a vital role in the improvement of product quality and production efficiency. Although DL technology has been widely used in the field of natural image, industrial image often has some mixed characteristics, such as small sample, imbalance, small target, strong interference, fine-grained, temporality and semantical, which reduce the feasibility and generalization of DLBIIPR. To solve this problem, this paper provides an overview of approaches commonly used in industry by enriching the sample space and limiting the hypothesis space. In order to improve the confidence of front-line workers in using DL models, the explainable deep learning (XDL) methods are reviewed, and a case study is used to verify the effectiveness of XDL.},

Correct identification of features responsible for the defects increases predictive power and informs manufacturers of potential corrective/preventive actions for process improvement. We solve the feature selection through resampling strategies integrated with ensemble procedures to handle data uncertainty and imbalance. Exploiting data uncertainty in our search leads to finding robust features with consistent predictive power.

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) has transitioned from a rapid prototyping method to a viable manufacturing tool. AM technologies can produce parts on-demand, repair damaged components, and provide an increased freedom of design not previously attainable by traditional manufacturing techniques. The increasing maturation of metal AM is attracting high-value industries to directly produce components for use in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, and energy ﬁelds. Two leading processes for metal part production are Powder Bed Fusion with laser beam (PBF-LB/M) and Directed Energy Deposition with laser beam (DED-LB/M). Despite the many advances made with these technologies, the highly dynamic nature of the process frequently results in the formation of defects. These technologies are also notoriously difﬁcult to control, and the existing machines do not offer closed loop control. In the present work, the application of various Machine Learning (ML) approaches and in-situ monitoring technologies for the purpose of defect detection are reviewed. The potential of these methods for enabling process control implementation is discussed. We provide a critical review of trends in the usage of data structures and ML algorithms and compare the capabilities of different sensing technologies and their application to monitoring tasks in laser metal AM. The future direction of this ﬁeld is then discussed, and recommendations for further research are provided.},

	abstract = {The possibility of using a variety of sensor signals acquired during metal powder bed fusion processes, to support part and process qualification and for the early detection of anomalies and defects, has been continuously attracting an increasing interest. The number of research studies in this field has been characterised by significant growth in the last few years, with several advances and new solutions compared with first seminal works. Moreover, industrial powder bed fusion (PBF) systems are increasingly equipped with sensors and toolkits for data collection, visualisation and, in some cases, embedded in-process analysis. Many new methods have been proposed and defect detection capabilities have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, several challenges and open issues still need to be tackled to bridge the gap between methods proposed in the literature and actual industrial implementation. This paper presents an updated review of the literature on in-situ sensing, measurement and monitoring for metal PBF processes, with a classification of methods and a comparison of enabled performances. The study summarises the types and sizes of defects that are practically detectable while the part is being produced and the research areas where additional technological advances are currently needed.},

Response Surface Methodology, Multi-layer Perceptron, Support Vector Regression, Random Forests, Gaussian Process, and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System were fitted and compared to predict essential features in laser-printed metallic parts. Using the Box-Behnken design of experiment (DOE), a range of process parameters was selected to assess the impact of laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness on the surface roughness and mechanical properties. It is worth noticing that the simultaneous inclusion of hatch spacing and layer thickness as input variables hasn't been widely investigated in the literature. The generalization capabilities of the fitted models were verified with additional experimental points not included in the training and testing procedures. The comparison conducted shows that there is no unique model capable of accurately predicting all the studied variables. It was necessary to consider more than one technique for reliable forecasting. Besides, combining the most accurate regressors into ensemble formulations increased, in some cases, the predictability of the stand-alone models themselves. Therefore, the two main contributions of this paper rely on the fitting of accurate modeling methods and characterizing the behavior of printing parameters on crucial features of the SLM process. Moreover, the presented modeling strategies could be used as references for further studies on the topic, particularly in optimization frameworks where these models could be implemented either as targets functions or constraints.},

The ability to identify Data Analytics (DA) opportunities for effective use of AM data becomes a critical factor in the success of AM. To successfully identify high-potential DA opportunities in AM requires a set of distinctive interdisciplinary knowledge. This paper proposes a methodology that enables collaborative knowledge management for identifying and prioritizing DA opportunities in AM. The framework of the proposed methodology has three components: a team of experts, a DA Opportunity Knowledge Base (DOKB), and a prioritization tool. The team of experts provides diverse knowledge that can be used to identify and prioritize DA opportunities. The DOKB, developed by using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), captures diverse knowledge from the experts to identify DA opportunities. The prioritization tool ranks the identified DA opportunities by using the Fuzzy integrated Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (Fuzzy-TOPSIS). A case study, in which National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) researchers participated, demonstrates our methodology. As a result, 264 DA opportunities for AM’s Laser-Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process are identified and prioritized. The prioritized DA opportunities help set a DA direction for L-PBF AM. Our methodology keeps knowledge sharable, reusable, revisable, and extendable. Thus, this methodology can continue to facilitate collaboration within the AM community to identify high potential and high impact DA opportunities in AM.},

Some methods that are already industrially available in laser powder bed fusion systems, such as in situ detection of recoating errors, have not yet been investigated and tested in electron beam melting. Motivated by the attempt to ﬁll this gap, we present a novel in situ monitoring methodology that can be easily implemented in industrial electron beam melting machines. The method is aimed at identifying local inhomogeneity and irregularities in the powder bed by means of layerwise image acquisition and processing, with no external illumination source apart from the light emitted by the hot material underneath the currently recoated layer. The results show that the proposed approach is suitable to detect powder bed anomalies, while also highlighting the link between the severity of in situ detected errors and the severity of resulting defects in the additively manufactured part.},

It offers the prospect of mass customization, flexible production, on-demand and decentralized manufacturing. However, a number of challenges stem from not only the complexity of manufacturing systems but the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, in terms of design principles, standardization and quality control. These challenges build up barriers to the widespread adoption of AM in the industry and the in-depth research of AM in academia. To tackle the challenges, machine learning (ML) technologies rise to play a crit­ ical role as they are able to provide effective ways to quality control, process optimization, modelling of complex systems, and energy management. Hence, this paper employs a systematic literature review method as it is a defined and methodical way of identifying, assessing, and analysing published literature. Then, a keyword cooccurrence and cluster analysis are employed for analysing relevant literature. Several aspects of AM, including Design for AM (DfAM), material analytics, in situ monitoring and defect detection, property prediction and sustainability, have been clustered and summarized to present state-of-the-art research in the scope of ML for AM.

Due to the advances in data sensing and collection technologies, a large amount of data, generated from multiple sources in AM production, becomes available for relevant analytics to improve process reliability, repeatability, and part quality. However, AM processes occur over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales where the data generally involves different types, dimensions and structures, leading to difficulties when integrating and then analysing. Hence, in what way and how to integrate the heterogeneous data or merge the spatial and temporal information lead to significant challenges in data analytics for AM systems. This paper proposed a task-driven data fusion framework that enables the integration of heterogeneous data from different sources and modal­ ities based on tasks to support decision-making activities. In this framework, the data analytics activities involved in the task are identified in the first place. Then, the data required for the task is identified, collected, and characterised. Finally, data fusion techniques are employed and applied based on the characteristics of the data for integration to support data analytics. The fusion techniques that best fit the task requirements are selected as the final fusion approach. Case studies on different research directions of AM, including AM energy consumption prediction, mechanical properties prediction of additively manufactured lattice structures, and investigation of remelting process on part density, were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the pro­ posed framework and approaches.},

	abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) is recognized as one of the most common additive manufacturing technologies because of its attractive capability of fabricating complex geometries using many possible materials. However, the quality and reliability of parts produced by this technology are observed to be crucial aspects. In addition, the challenges of PBF-produced parts are hot issues among stakeholders because parts are still insufﬁcient to meet the strict requirements of high-tech industries. This paper discusses the present state of the art in PBF and technological challenges, with a focus on selective laser melting (SLM). The review work focuses mainly on articles that emphasize the status and challenges of PBF metal-based AM, and the study is primarily limited to open-access sources, with special attention given to the process parameters and ﬂaws as a determining factor for printed part quality and reliability. Moreover, the common defects due to an unstrained process parameter of SLM and those needed to monitor and sustain the quality and reliability of components are encompassed. From this review work, it has been observed that there are several factors, such as laser parameters, powder characteristics, material properties of powder and the printing chamber environments, that affect the SLM printing process and the mechanical properties of printed parts. It is also concluded that the SLM process is not only expensive and slow compared with conventional manufacturing processes, but it also suffers from key drawbacks, such as its reliability and quality in terms of dimensional accuracy, mechanical strength and surface roughness.},

	abstract = {The application of three-dimensional (3D) printing/Additive Manufacturing (AM) for developing multi-functional smart/intelligent composite materials is a highly promising area of engineering research. However, there is often no reliable means for predicting and modelling the material performance, and the wide-scale industrial adoption of AM is limited due to factors such as design barriers, limited materials library, processing defects and inconsistency in product quality. A comprehensive framework considering the generalised applicability of ML algorithms at sub-sequent stages of the AM process from the initial design to the post-processing stages in the literature is lacking. In this paper, the integration of various ML applications at various subprocesses is discussed, including pre-processing design stage, parameter optimisation, anomaly detection, in-situ monitoring, and the ﬁnal post-processing stages. The challenges and potential solutions for standardising these integrated techniques have been identiﬁed. The article is promising for professionals and researchers in AM and AI/ML techniques.},

The technique is combined with a dedicated procedure based on deep machine learning models. The investigated samples were fabricated from different metal alloy powders by using the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS®) technique. The experimental data for model development were in the form of laser shot-induced temperature fields, obtained from an original, in-house developed test apparatus. The advantage of the proposed methodology is that it can be used for the nondestructive measurements of the additively manufactured jet engine blades, which distinguishes the presented approach from the traditional laser-flash technique or other well-established methods. The obtained experimental values of the thermal diffusivity are in good agreement with data measured using the ASTM standard test method. The presented non-destructive technique has significant implementation/commercialization potential when applied to quality control or diagnostic procedures of 3D-printed parts.},

Monitoring is a key tool for this purpose but the typical AM fast process dynamics and the high data ﬂow required to accurately describe the process are pushing the limits of standard statistical process monitoring (SPM) techniques. The adoption of novel smart data extraction and analysis methods are fundamental to monitor the process with the required accuracy while keeping the computational effort to a reasonable level for real-time application. In this work, a new framework for the detection of defects in metal additive manufacturing processes via in-situ high-speed cameras is presented: a new data extraction method is developed to efﬁciently extract only the relevant information from the regions of interest identiﬁed in the high-speed imaging data stream and to reduce the dimensionality of the anomaly detection task performed by three competitor machine learning classiﬁcation methods. The defect detection performance and computational speed of this approach is carefully evaluated through computer simulations and experimental studies, and directly compared with the performance and computational speed of other existing methods applied on the same reference dataset. The results show that the proposed method is capable of quickly detecting the occurrence of defects while keeping the high computational speed that would be required to implement this new process monitoring approach for real-time defect detection.},

	abstract = {Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is a branch of Additive Manufacturing (AM) that offers extraordinary controllability and the ability to rapidly shape materials directly into large parts with complex structures. Innovative applications of machine learning and neural network algorithms in additive manufacturing processes have recently been developed, but there are still several barriers to the development and practical application of this technology. The large amount of sample data required for visual inspection using a neural network framework leads to the problem of difficult and costly preparation of surface morphology data. In this study, a transfer learning approach based on a small dataset is proposed to detect surface morphology in the DED pro­ cedure. The approach proposed effectively and innovatively addresses the sample scarcity issue that arises during neural network training and eliminates the issue of having to recreate a sizable quantity of the matching surface sample data. It also effectively accelerates the model convergence process through the transfer learning method, which indirectly improves detection accuracy. This work selected a parametric transfer learning approach to train YOLOv7, a self-supervised object detection model, for transfer learning. The experiments utilized an opensource defective dataset (NEU-DEF) for transfer learning pretraining. The training was carried out in combination with a home-made object dataset of 240 small samples after transfer of the model parameters. The input to the model is image data and the output of the training is the classification of surface morphology. The results show that the transfer training model 2 pretrained with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm has high accuracy and precision, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) value of 0.62. Transfer learning speeds up the feature extraction process by transferring the parameters of a pretrained model for a similar task directly into the current task model, resulting in improved detection performance.},

	abstract = {The use of video-imaging data for in-line process monitoring applications has become popular in industry. In this framework, spatio-temporal statistical process monitoring methods are needed to capture the relevant information content and signal possible out-of-control states. Video-imaging data are characterized by a spatio-temporal variability structure that depends on the underlying phenomenon, and typical out-of-control patterns are related to events that are localized both in time and space. In this article, we propose an integrated spatio-temporal decomposition and regression approach for anomaly detection in video-imaging data. Out-of-control events are typically sparse, spatially clustered and temporally consistent. The goal is not only to detect the anomaly as quickly as possible (“when”) but also to locate it in space (“where”). The proposed approach works by decomposing the original spatio-temporal data into random natural events, sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent anomalous events, and random noise. Recursive estimation procedures for spatio-temporal regression are presented to enable the real-time implementation of the proposed methodology. Finally, a likelihood ratio test procedure is proposed to detect when and where the anomaly happens. The proposed approach was applied to the analysis of high-sped video-imaging data to detect and locate local hot-spots during a metal additive manufacturing process.},

However, abnormal states (those with defects) happen significantly less frequently than normal ones (those without defects), resulting in the collected dataset usually containing fewer defect samples than normal ones, which deteriorates the performance of defect detection in additive manufacturing. To address this issue, a novel contrastive learning-based semantic segmentation model, termed cLass-aware Semantic Contrast and Attention amalgamation (LSCA), is proposed to accurately detect the in-situ stratified defect with imbalanced data. LSCA is equipped with a defect memory bank which is devised to store and retrieve class-aware semantic memory from poorly labeled training data. In particular, class-aware semantic contrast is devised to drive network learning by contrasting all categorical defect regions, leading to a more holistic defect pattern understanding. Further, class-aware attention amalgamation is developed to assemble various relationship contexts in the defect memory to enrich semantic representations. The extensive experiments demonstrate that, despite the imbalanced labeling of the training dataset, our LSCA consistently outperforms cutting-edge semantic segmentation techniques for detecting in-situ stratified defects in additive manufacturing.},

Since models are most useful when they can correctly predict experimental observations, we focus on the available mechanistic models of AM that have been adequately validated. Specifically, the applications of transport phenomena models in the studies of solidification, residual stresses, distortion, formation of defects and the evolution of microstructure and prop­ erties are critically reviewed.

Each layer produces an image where the pixel position represents the laser coordinates and the pixel intensity denotes the sensor response. The 3D image stacks represent the infrared emission during the manufacturing of the physical component. However, interpreting monitoring data remains a challenge. To address this issue, this study evaluates the performance of a near-infrared photodiode in detecting typical geometrical features such as porosity and overhanging structures ranging from the micro-to-meso scale. Monitoring data is highly sensitive to heat accumulation around overhanging structures and can quantify dross formation based on hotspots. Cold spots, which represent a lack of fusion porosity at scan track intersections, can indicate a probability of defect formation. However, the sensitivity and predictive value of monitoring data for porosity are low due to the healing of defects in subsequent layers. Local process variables, such as the scan strategy and part orientation, signiﬁcantly inﬂuence dross and hot spot formation. This study shows the potential of NIR photodiodes in deriving metrics for in-line certiﬁcation of L-PBF components, leading to improved process control and quality assurance.},

Meanwhile, phased array inspection or phased-array ultrasonic testing techniques as a well-known type of ultrasonic testing in advanced non-destructive testing systems are utilized in numerous applications, including oil and gas, medical imaging applications, railway, automotive, marine, and aviation industries. Phased-array ultrasonic testing-based methods can also be used in a variety of weld inspections, bond testing, thickness proﬁling, ﬂaw detections, corrosion inspections, and in-service crack detection. The rapidity, safety, easiness, affordable price, and accurate visualization of phased array in measuring the defect characteristics such as size, shape, depth, and orientation allow its wide usage and even as a substitute for other inspection methods like radiographic methods. In phased array methods, more than one sound wave is employed to enhance the reliability and ﬂexibility of inspection through the operation of several transducer assemblies, involving 16 to 256 small individual elements. Titanium having many desirable properties like high strength to weight ratio found many industrial applications, which highly necessitates its persistent inspection. For this aim, the present study focuses on the application of the phased-array ultrasonic testing technique for inspecting Ti components speciﬁcally in additive manufacturing, welding inspections, and defect detection of complex geometries and composites. Moreover, modern applications and improved computation methods are discussed. The development of phased-array ultrasonic testing inspection systems, particularly high throughput and efﬁcient in situ and mobile equipment, and new computation methods will open new horizons toward the highly sophisticated inspection procedures.},

Existing works of process–property relationships for porosity prediction require many experiments or computationally expensive simulations without considering environmental variations. While efforts that adopt real-time monitoring sensors can only detect porosity after its occurrence rather than predicting it ahead of time. In this study, a novel porosity detection-prediction framework is proposed based on deep learning that predicts porosity in the next layer based on thermal signatures of the previous layers. The proposed framework is validated in terms of its ability to accurately predict lack of fusion porosity using computerized tomography (CT) scans, which achieves a F1-score of 0.75. The framework presented in this work can be effectively applied to quality control in additive manufacturing. As a function of the predicted porosity positions, laser process parameters in the next layer can be adjusted to avoid more part porosity in the future or the existing porosity could be ﬁlled. If the predicted part porosity is not acceptable regardless of laser parameters, the building process can be stopped to minimize the loss.},

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) has transitioned from a rapid prototyping method to a viable manufacturing tool. AM technologies can produce parts on-demand, repair damaged components, and provide an increased freedom of design not previously attainable by traditional manufacturing techniques. The increasing maturation of metal AM is attracting high-value industries to directly produce components for use in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, and energy ﬁelds. Two leading processes for metal part production are Powder Bed Fusion with laser beam (PBF-LB/M) and Directed Energy Deposition with laser beam (DED-LB/M). Despite the many advances made with these technologies, the highly dynamic nature of the process frequently results in the formation of defects. These technologies are also notoriously difﬁcult to control, and the existing machines do not offer closed loop control. In the present work, the application of various Machine Learning (ML) approaches and in-situ monitoring technologies for the purpose of defect detection are reviewed. The potential of these methods for enabling process control implementation is discussed. We provide a critical review of trends in the usage of data structures and ML algorithms and compare the capabilities of different sensing technologies and their application to monitoring tasks in laser metal AM. The future direction of this ﬁeld is then discussed, and recommendations for further research are provided.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Welding is a major manufacturing process that joins two or more pieces of materials together through heating/mixing them followed by cooling/solidification. The goal of welding manufacturing is to join materials together to meet service requirements at lowest costs. Advanced welding manufacturing is to use scientific methods to realize this goal. This paper views advanced welding manufacturing as a three step approach: (1) pre-design that selects process and joint design based on available processes (properties, capabilities, and costs); (2) design that uses models to predict the result from a given set of welding parameters and minimizes a cost function for optimizing the welding parameters; and (3) real-time sensing and control that overcome the deviations of welding conditions from their nominal ones used in optimizing the welding parameters by adjusting the welding parameters based on such real-time sensing and feedback control. The paper analyzes how these three steps depend on process properties/capabilities, process innovations, predictive models, numerical models for fluid dynamics, numerical models for structures, real-time sensing, and dynamic control. The paper also identifies the challenges in obtaining ideal solutions and reviews/analyzes the existing efforts toward better solutions. Special attention and analysis have been given to (1) gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) and gas metal arc welding (GMAW) as benchmark processes for penetration and materials filling; (2) keyhole plasma arc welding (PAW), keyhole-tungsten inert gas (K-TIG), and keyhole laser welding as improved/capable penetrative processes; (3) friction stir welding (FSW) as a special penetrative low heat input process; (4) alternating current (AC) GMAW and double-electrode GMAW as improved materials filling processes; (5) efforts in numerical modeling for fluid dynamics; (6) efforts in numerical modeling for structures; (7) challenges and efforts in seam tracking and weld pool monitoring; (8) challenges and efforts in monitoring of keyhole laser welding and FSW; and (9) efforts in advanced sensing, data fusion/sensor fusion, and process control using machine learning/deep learning, model predictive control (MPC), and adaptive control.},

Theory-inspired machine learning combines the available models and data, reaping the benefits of established knowledge and the capabilities of modern, data-driven approaches. Compared to purely physics- or purely data-driven models, the models resulting from theory-inspired machine learning are often more accurate and less complex, extrapolate better, or allow faster model training or inference.

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), an enabler of Industry 4.0, recently opened limitless possibilities in various sectors covering personal, industrial, medical, aviation and even extra-terrestrial applications. Although signiﬁcant research thrust is prevalent on this topic, a detailed review covering the impact, status, and prospects of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector has been ignored in the literature. Therefore, this review provides comprehensive information on smart mechanisms and systems emphasizing additive, subtractive and/or hybrid manufacturing processes in a collaborative, predictive, decisive, and intelligent environment. Relevant electronic databases were searched, and 248 articles were selected for qualitative synthesis. Our review suggests that signiﬁcant improvements are required in connectivity, data sensing, and collection to enhance both subtractive and additive technologies, though the pervasive use of AI by machines and software helps to automate processes. An intelligent system is highly recommended in both conventional and non-conventional subtractive manufacturing (SM) methods to monitor and inspect the workpiece conditions for defect detection and to control the machining strategies in response to instantaneous output. Similarly, AM product quality can be improved through the online monitoring of melt pool and defect formation using suitable sensing devices followed by process control using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Challenges in implementing intelligent additive and subtractive manufacturing systems are also discussed in the article. The challenges comprise difﬁculty in self-optimizing CNC systems considering real-time material property and tool condition, defect detections by in-situ AM process monitoring, issues of overﬁtting and underﬁtting data in ML models and expensive and complicated set-ups in hybrid manufacturing processes.},

	abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that has the potential to produce almost any three-dimensional (3D) metallic part, even those with complicated shapes. Throughout the SLM process, the heat transfer characteristics of the metal powder plays a signiﬁcant role in maintaining the product quality during 3D printing. Thus, it is crucial for 3D-printing manufacturers to determine the thermal behavior over the SLM process. However, it is a signiﬁcant challenge to accurately determine the large temperature gradient and the melt pool size using only experiments. Therefore, the use of both experimental investigations and numerical analysis can assist in characterizing the temperature evaluation and the melt pool size in a more eﬀective manner. In this study, 3D ﬁnite element analysis applying a moving volumetric Gaussian laser heat source was used to analyze the temperature proﬁle on the powder bed and the resultant melt pool size throughout the SLM process. In the experiments, a TELOPS FAST-IR (M350) thermal imager was applied to determine the temperature proﬁle of the melting pool and powder bed along the scanning direction during the SLM fabrication using Ti6Al4V powder. The numerically calculated results were compared with the experimentally determined temperature distribution. The comparison showed that the calculated peak temperature for single- and multi-track by the developed thermal model was in good agreement with the experiment results. Secondly, the developed model was veriﬁed by comparing the melting pool size for various laser powers and scanning speeds with the experimentally measured melting pool size from the published literature. The developed model could predict the melt pool width (with 2–5\% error) and melt pool depth (with 5–6\% error).},

For the microscale creation, several femtosecond laser fabrication methods, including multiphoton absorption, laser-induced plasma-assisted ablation, and incubation effect have been developed. Meanwhile, the femtosecond laser can be combined with microlens arrays and interference lithography techniques to achieve the structures in submicron scales. Down to nanoscale feature sizes, advanced processing strategies, such as near-field scanning optical microscope, atomic force microscope, and microsphere, are applied in femtosecond laser processing and the minimum nanostructure creation has been pushed down to {\textasciitilde}25 nm due to near-field effect. The most fascinating femtosecond laser precision engineering is the possibility of large-area, high-throughput, and far-field nanofabrication. In combination with special strategies, including dual femtosecond laser beam irradiation, {\textasciitilde}15 nm nanostructuring can be achieved directly on silicon surfaces in far field and in ambient air.

For the SLM powder, the contrary situation was detected with better ﬂowability for the recycled powder. The reason for this could be referred to the powder layering process that results in a recycled powder with a decreased amount of ﬁner particles compared with the new powder.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing of metals has emerged as a potential technology for companies to create highly integrated and individualized products. In particular, powder-based laser metal deposition has advantages such as flexibility and multimaterial capabilities. It is possible to mix powders and create alloys inside the melt-pool during the build process. Consequently, purpose made material combinations with set or even varying thermal properties can be realized. Inherently, the process becomes increasingly challenging because of the great number of variables. Analyzation of the manufactured part ensures top quality and detects errors and defects. To accomplish this, specimens have to be x-rayed or ground and cut into microsections. In order to save time and keep the parts’ integrity, a new method uses temperature data from the process to determine irregularities. During the additive manufacturing process, a 680 W diode laser melts the substrate and the powder locally. The powder is composed of 42\% nickel and 58\% iron. A pyrometer samples the temperature of the molten pool at a spectral range from 1.45 to 1.85 μm. The recorded data are mapped onto the toolpath of the process head. A script converts the time dependent signal to spatially resolved temperature points. The feedrate and the laser status aid to synchronize the data throughout. As a result, the overlaid melt-pool temperature visualizes the process and creates a tomography for the produced part. Initial experiments show that errors and defects like porosities and cavities are identifiable inside the manufactured structure. Furthermore, correlations between the visualization and errors detected with microsections are possible. Overall, this technique is an addition to the repertoire of data visualization and quality control in additive manufacturing and can be transferred to other machines and laser processes.},

Starting from computer-aided designed data, components are built layer by layer within a powder bed by selectively melting the powder with a high power electron beam. In contrast to selective laser melting (SLM), which can be used for metals, polymers and ceramics, the application ﬁeld of the electron beam is restricted to metallic components since electric conductivity is required. On the other hand, the electron beam works under vacuum conditions, can be moved at extremely high velocities and a high beam power is available. These features make SEBM especially interesting for the processing of high-performance alloys. The present review describes SEBM with special focus on the relationship between process characteristics, material consolidation and the resulting materials and component properties.},

	abstract = {With the increasing development of remote sensing platforms and the evolution of sampling facilities in mining and oil industry, spatial datasets are becoming increasingly large, inform a growing number of variables and cover wider and wider areas. Therefore, it is often necessary to split the domain of study to account for radically different behaviors of the natural phenomenon over the domain and to simplify the subsequent modeling step. The deﬁnition of these areas can be seen as a problem of unsupervised classiﬁcation, or clustering, where we try to divide the domain into homogeneous domains with respect to the values taken by the variables in hand. The application of classical clustering methods, designed for independent observations, does not ensure the spatial coherence of the resulting classes. Image segmentation methods, based on e.g. Markov random ﬁelds, are not adapted to irregularly sampled data. Other existing approaches, based on mixtures of Gaussian random functions estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm, are limited to reasonable sample sizes and a small number of variables. In this work, we propose two algorithms based on adaptations of classical algorithms to multivariate geostatistical data. Both algorithms are model free and can handle large volumes of multivariate, irregularly spaced data. The ﬁrst one proceeds by agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The spatial coherence is ensured by a proximity condition imposed for two clusters to merge. This proximity condition relies on a graph organizing the data in the coordinates space. The hierarchical algorithm can then be seen as a graph-partitioning algorithm. Following this interpretation, a spatial version of the spectral clustering algorithm is also proposed. The performances of both algorithms are assessed on toy examples and a mining dataset.},

The initial cluster centers are effectively selected from those points which lie on the boundary of higher radius Voronoi circles. As a result, the proposed method automates the selection of the initial cluster centers to supply them for K-means. The proposed method is experimented on various artificial (hand-made) as well as real world data sets of various dimensions.

	abstract = {In many modern applications, including analysis of gene expression and text documents, the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and unordered--with no particular meaning to the given order of the variables. Yet, successful learning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that the data are typically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only a few features. In this paper we present treelets--a novel construction of multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth signals. The method is fully adaptive, as it returns a hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis which both reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are especially well-suited as a dimensionality reduction and feature selection tool prior to regression and classification, in situations where sample sizes are small and the data are sparse with unknown groupings of correlated or collinear variables. The method is also simple to implement and analyze theoretically. Here we describe a variety of situations where treelets perform better than principal component analysis, as well as some common variable selection and cluster averaging schemes. We illustrate treelets on a blocked covariance model and on several data sets (hyperspectral image data, DNA microarray data, and internet advertisements) with highly complex dependencies between variables.},

            The powder bed fusion-based additive manufacturing process uses a laser to melt and fuse powder metal material together and creates parts with intricate surface topography that are often influenced by laser path, layer-to-layer scanning strategies, and energy density. Surface topography investigations of as-built, nickel alloy (625) surfaces were performed by obtaining areal height maps using focus variation microscopy for samples produced at various energy density settings and two different scan strategies. Surface areal height maps and measured surface texture parameters revealed the highly irregular nature of surface topography created by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Effects of process parameters and energy density on the areal surface texture have been identified. Machine learning methods were applied to measured data to establish input and output relationships between process parameters and measured surface texture parameters with predictive capabilities. The advantages of utilizing such predictive models for process planning purposes are highlighted.},

When processing the fresh, as-received powder in a wellcontrolled environment, the oxide inclusions contained in the precursor powder were the primary contributors to the formation of nano-scale oxides in the ﬁnal additive manufactured (AM) product. These oxide inclusions were found to be enriched with oxygen getter elements like Si and Mn. By controlling the extraneous oxygen level in the process environment, the oxygen level in AM produced parts was found to increase with the extraneous oxygen level. The intrusion pathway of this extra oxygen was found to be dominated by the incorporation of spatter particles into the build during processing. Moisture induced oxidation during powder storage was also found to result in a higher oxide density in the AM produced parts. SS 316L powder free of Si and Mn oxygen getters was processed in a well-controlled environment and resulted in a similar level of oxygen intrusion. Microhardness testing indicated that the oxide volume fraction increase from extraneous oxygen did not inﬂuence hardness values. However, a marked decrease in hardness was found for the humidiﬁed and Si-Mn free AM processed parts.},

Even though this is a generally accepted fact, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the powder property–part property relationship. However, numerous investigations focusing on selected powder properties and their corresponding influence on process aspects or final part properties have been published in recent years. Still, generalized statements on powder requirements for a defined process performance are not available. This can be attributed to the fact that the community has not yet come to an agreement which characterization techniques are most suitable for powder characterization in the additive manufacturing context and in most cases only selected aspects have been investigated for special powder materials. The aim of this review is to assess these building blocks of knowledge and to provide an overview on the current state of the art.},

While there are several design choices when selecting a unit cell, it is not always apparent what the optimum cellular design for a particular application is. This becomes particularly challenging when seeking an optimal design for more than one function, or when the design needs to transition spatially between different functions. Nature abounds with examples of cellular materials that are able to achieve multifunctionality, but designers lack the ability to translate the underlying principles in these examples to their design tools. In this work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between nature and designer. We present a classification of natural cellular materials based on their structure and function, and relate them in a manner amenable for use in guiding design for Additive Manufacturing.},

Through control of various parameters lattice structures can produce unique mechanical, electrical, thermal and acoustic properties, and have received much research attention. Despite the increasing volume of published data on the mechanical response of speciﬁc SLM lattice structures, there exists no overarching analysis. This work addresses this identiﬁed deﬁciency by providing a comprehensive summary of the experimental data reported on the mechanical response of SLM lattice structures. The design, fabrication and performance of SLM lattice structures are reviewed and the quality of data reported is analysed to inform best-practice for future studies. This comprehensive data summary enables meta-analysis of the reported mechanical performance of SLM lattice structures, providing insight into the bounds of their technical capabilities. Correlations were identiﬁed between the relative density and mechanical properties of many unit cell topologies consistent with the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby model, indicating its usefulness in describing and predicting the behaviour of SLM lattice structures. This review provides designers with a compiled resource of experimental data and design for AM tools to inform future design applications of SLM lattice structures and facilitates their further commercial adoption.},

It is an emerging horizon that looks to the natural world for ideas and inspiration for all kinds of design opportunities. In the search of sustainable building design and technology Biomimicry is an alternative solution. The inspiration from nature is driving force in architecture, resulting in majestic works of architecture. Biomimicry is about solution refined and developed by nature. These principles help designers to create products, processes, and policies that are well adapted to life on earth in its long run. Sometimes human designed solutions are cruder and more additive than the nature‘s solutions of the same problem. As we seek new ways to design and live sustainably, and in many cases have solved the same problems with a far greater economy of means. It is a design principle seeking sustainable solutions to divert attention towards nature‘s solution for human problems by consulting and emulating nature‘s tested and tried patterns and strategies. The primary idea is that necessity requires nature to be imaginative. Through this imagination, nature has successfully solved many of the problems that designers today are still struggling to solve. The behavioral and operational systems of the nature have a lot to teach and inspire us, provided we as architects and designers open our eyes towards it. The core idea is that nature already has all the remedies hidden in its deepest sanctuaries, we just have to be insolent and find it. Nature‘s consummate engineers – flora and fauna, have held in themselves the secret of survival. Aim is revealing how radical increase in resource efficiency can be achieved by looking to the nature for inspiration. For any sustainable building design, structural efficiency, water efficiency, zero-waste systems, thermal environment, and energy efficiency, Biomimicry is all about deriving solutions from nature.},

	abstract = {Micro computed tomography (microCT) allows non-destructive insights into the quality of additively manufactured parts and the processes that produce them. MicroCT has been used widely in this industry but the use of this technique is often time consuming and costly which reduces its potential impact and the beneﬁts associated with its use. By using standardized test procedures, the analysis time and cost can be minimized and conﬁdence in obtained results increased. A round robin test was conducted as follows: a series of standard test procedures (part sizes and shapes and test protocols) were applied – using one microCT system – to identical parts produced on a variety of metal additive manufacturing systems (speciﬁcally laser powder bed fusion systems). These are simple parts: a 10 mm cube, a 15 mm diameter vertical-built cylinder and a basic topology optimized example part – a bracket. The 15 mm diameter cylinder acts as witness specimen for the build of the complex part. All these were produced in Ti6Al4V, and in some cases parts were provided with variations in process parameters or manufacturing conditions which led to diﬀerent types of intentional manufacturing ﬂaws or defects. Various intentional and unintentional ﬂaws were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. The major result shown is that the analysis of a simple 10 mm cube clearly identiﬁes incorrect process parameters even for very low levels of porosity, with unique porosity distributions and characteristics. It is found that generally this porosity extends to larger, more complex parts. The witness specimen (15 mm cylinder) allows clear identiﬁcation of layered stop-start ﬂaws, at a resolution better than a complex part built alongside it, allowing to identify defective builds. The results indicate a successful ﬁrst step at standardized microCT analysis procedures for improvement of processes and quality control in additive manufacturing.},

A manual data analysis method is given, and the events indicated by the analysis (DMP-meltpool events) are shown to correlate to the static tensile properties of the samples built. These events indicate the probability of material discontinuities (defects) in the metal additive manufacturing (AM) parts. In order to do so, cylindrical bars of Ti-6Al-4V ELI were built and monitored using DMP-meltpool. The tensile properties of the printed cylinders were correlated with the events detected by DMP-meltpool. An inverse relation between plastic elongation and the DMP-meltpool event density was observed. These results show that DMPmeltpool can be used to predict the quality of AM parts by detecting variations in the signals and tagging these events throughout the build as defects. Thus the technique can be employed for ﬁrst stage in-line quality control of AM parts and for sorting out parts with potential defects non-destructively. The DMP-meltpool events could have signiﬁcant correlations with other mechanical properties (like fatigue, hardness, fracture toughness, and crack propagation) since such properties are inﬂuenced by defects originating from the process instabilities.},

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to designing cellular materials, borrowing concepts of symmetry from mathematics and the arts to manipulate 2dimensional square honeycombs of uniform thickness, starting from a regular, periodic square, gradually varying symmetry and the number of shapes to create a range of forms. We report results of compression testing of specimens made with the Fused Deposition Modeling process, and study the effective specific properties of the honeycombs with regard to their peak stress at failure, densification strain and energy absorption. We report weak to no correlation to the first two of these, but demonstrate how asymmetry and negative space may be leveraged to formulate design principles for energy absorption.},

However, minimal surface designs in this density range are shown to have very thin walls, potentially making their accurate production more challenging, or more suitable for applications where larger pore sizes and sheet thicknesses may be applicable. Interesting results such as dual pore size distributions and variations in tortuosity of pore networks are demonstrated, with diﬀerences between various designs.

            The capabilities of metal additive manufacturing (AM) are evolving rapidly thanks to both increasing industry demand and improved scientific understanding of the process. This article provides an overview of AM of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, which has essentially been used as a yardstick to gauge the capability of each metal AM process developed to date. It begins by summarizing the metal AM processes existing today. This is followed by a discussion of the macro- and microstructural characteristics, defects, and tensile and fatigue properties of AM Ti-6Al-4V by selective laser melting, laser metal deposition (both powder and wire), and selective electron-beam melting compared to non-AM Ti-6Al-4V. The tensile and fatigue properties of as-built AM Ti-6Al-4V (with machined or polished surfaces) can be made comparable, or even superior, to those of Ti-6Al-4V in the most commonly used mill-annealed condition. However, these properties can exhibit a large degree of scatter and are often anisotropic, affected by AM build orientations. Post-AM surface treatments or both the post-AM surface and heat treatments are necessary to ensure the minimum required properties and performance consistency. Future directions to further unlock the potential of AM of Ti-6Al-4V for superior and consistent mechanical properties are also discussed.},

This can be achieved with cellular materials, such as honeycombs, foams and lattices. Designing structures with cellular materials involves answering an important question: What is the optimum unit cell for the application of interest? There is currently no classiﬁcation framework that describes the spectrum of cellular materials, and no methodology to guide the designer in selecting among the inﬁnite list of possibilities. In this paper, we ﬁrst review traditional engineering methods currently in use for selecting cellular materials in design. We then develop a classiﬁcation scheme for the different types of cellular materials, dividing them into three levels of design decisions: tessellation, element type and connectivity. We demonstrate how a biomimetic approach helps a designer make decisions at all three levels. The scope of this paper is limited to the structural domain, but the methodology developed here can be extended to the design of components in thermal, ﬂuid, optical and other areas. A deeper purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how traditional methods in design can be combined with a biomimetic approach.},

In each case, the nominal or heritage part has undergone topology optimization, incorporating the AM manufacturing constraints that include: minimization of support structures, ability to remove unsintered powder, and minimization of heat transfer jumps that will cause artifact warpage. To this end the topology optimization exercise must be coupled to the Additive Manufacturing build direction, and steps are incorporated to integrate the AM constraints.

	abstract = {Manufacturing-oriented topology optimization has been extensively studied the past two decades, in particular for the conventional manufacturing methods, for example, machining and injection molding or casting. Both design and manufacturing engineers have benefited from these efforts because of the close-to-optimal and friendly-to-manufacture design solutions. Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) has received significant attention from both academia and industry. AM is characterized by producing geometrically complex components layer-by-layer, and greatly reduces the geometric complexity restrictions imposed on topology optimization by conventional manufacturing. In other words, AM can make near-full use of the freeform structural evolution of topology optimization. Even so, new rules and restrictions emerge due to the diverse and intricate AM processes, which should be carefully addressed when developing the AM-specific topology optimization algorithms. Therefore, the motivation of this perspective paper is to summarize the state-of-art topology optimization methods for a variety of AM topics. At the same time, this paper also expresses the authors’ perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in these topics. The hope is to inspire both researchers and engineers to meet these challenges with innovative solutions.},

	abstract = {Hollow-walled lattices are a recent optimization upon the conventional dense-walled lattice design. These novel microstructures can achieve extremely low densities while exhibiting robust technical properties including high ductility, strength, and stiffness. However, the current fabrication process for these structures is ineffective, requiring multiple additive and subtractive manufacturing processes to produce a single specimen. The appli­ cation of a single step additive manufacturing (AM) method has not yet been evaluated for hollow-walled lattice fabrication. This study aims to assess the viability of such a method, enabling greater geometric control, and providing a single process to reduce both time and cost. The manufacturability of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) will be explored through Ti6Al4V hollow-walled struts and lattices at varying diameters, lengths, and inclination angles while retaining a constant wall thickness. Quasi static compressional testing will also occur upon the hollow-walled body-centered cubic lattices with a reinforced strut in the Z-axis (BCCZ). These experimental BCCZ lattices have been fabricated at relative densities ranging from 5 to 40\%, and strength and modulus values have been observed between 4 and 25 MPa, and 750–3640 MPa, respectively. The resultant data will assist in the generation of the Gibson-Ashby Model to systematically compare LPBF Ti6Al4V hollow-walled lattices to re­ ported dense-walled lattices. This study presents an exploration into the single-step fabrication of metal hollowwalled struts and lattices to broaden the scope of manufacturability and facilitate future advancements.},

	abstract = {Honeycomb structures have a wide range of applications, from medical implants to industrial components. In addition, honeycombs play a critical role when passive protection is required due to their low density and high energy absorption capabilities. With the transition of additive manufacturing from a rapid prototyping approach to a manufacturing process, this technology has recently offered designers and manufacturers the ability to fabricate and modify lattice structures such as honeycombs. The current study presents the application of laser powder bed fusion, a common additive manufacturing process for producing industrial metal components, for fabricating metal honeycombs. In addition, this study examines three modified designs that can only be practically fabricated using additive manufacturing and compares them with conventional honeycombs. For this purpose, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the honeycomb structures. The results show that the structures produced by additive manufacturing have acceptable performance compared to conventional honeycomb structures, and laser powder bed fusion can be considered to be a reliable manufacturing method for honeycomb production. Furthermore, the honeycombs produced according to the modified designs generally outperformed their counterparts made from the typical hexagonal cells. Ultimately, the use of triangular cells as a design modification is proposed to produce honeycombs with promising performance characteristics in all of their principal axes and under various pressure scenarios, from quasi-static to dynamic loading rates. Finally, this study also investigates the applicability of a newly developed maraging steel for additive manufacturing of honeycombs. Microstructural analysis and quasi-static tensile tests have confirmed the material properties for this purpose.},

	abstract = {There are three primary aspects to the economics of additive manufacturing: measuring the value of goods produced, measuring the costs and benefits of using the technology, and estimating the adoption and diffusion of the technology. This paper provides an updated estimate of the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on additive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the literature where this technology is cost effective. The paper then goes on to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal costs and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and a resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends in the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an estimated \$667 million in value added produced using additive manufacturing, which equates to 0.01 \% of total global manufacturing value added. US value added is estimated as \$241 million. Current research on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is cost effective for manufacturing small batches with continued centralized production; however, with increased automation distributed production may become cost effective. Due to the complexities of measuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current studies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine the production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend not to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation costs along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive manufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant portion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are declining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have resulted in this technology representing 0.02 \% of the relevant manufacturing industries in the US; however, as the costs of additive manufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely adopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer interactions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing reveals that for this technology to exceed \$4.4 billion in 2020, \$16.0 billion in 2025, and \$196.8 billion in 2035 it would need to deviate from its current trends of adoption.},

The lack of tooling makes RM economically suitable for low and medium production volumes. A comparison with traditional manufacturing processes is important; in particular, cost comparison. Cost is usually the key point for decision making, with break-even points for different manufacturing technologies being the dominant information for decision makers. Cost models used for traditional production methodologies focus on material and labour costs, while modern automated manufacturing processes need cost models that are able to consider the high impact of investments and overheads. Previous work on laser sintering costing was developed in 2003. This current work presents advances and discussions on the limits of the previous work through direct comparison. A new cost model for laser sintering is then proposed. The model leads to graph profiles that are typical for layer-manufacturing processes. The evolution of cost models and the indirect cost significance in modern costing representation is shown finally.},

	abstract = {This review article summarizes the current state-of-the-art for biomimicry in additive manufacturing. Biomimicry is the practice of learning from and emulating nature - which can be increasingly realized in engineering applications due to progress in additive manufacturing (AM). AM has grown tremendously in recent years, with improvements in technology and resulting material properties sometimes exceeding those of equivalent parts produced by traditional production processes. This has led to the industrial use of AM parts even in highly critical applications, most notably in aerospace, automotive and medical applications. The ability to create parts with complex geometries is one of the most important advantages of this technology, allowing the production of complex functional objects from various materials including plastics and metals that cannot be easily produced by any other means. Utilizing the full complexity allowed by AM is the key to unlocking the huge potential of this technology for real world applications – and biomimicry might be pivotal in this regard. Biomimicry may take different forms in AM, including customization of parts for individuals (e.g. medical prosthesis, implants or custom sports equipment), or optimization for specific properties such as stiffness and light-weighting (e.g. lightweight parts in aerospace or automotive applications). The optimization process often uses an iterative simulation-driven process analogous to biological evolution – with an improvement in every iteration. Other forms of biomimicry in AM include the incorporation of real biological inputs into designs (i.e. emulating nature for its unique properties); the use of cellular or lattice structures – for various applications and customized to the application; incorporating multi-functionality into designs; the consolidation of numerous parts into one and the reduction of waste, amongst others. Numerous biomimetic design approaches may be used – broadly categorized into customized/freeform, simulation-driven and lattice designs. All these approaches may be used in combination with one another, and in all cases with or without direct input from nature. The aim of this review is to unravel the different forms of biomimetic engineering that are now possible – focusing mainly on functional mechanical engineering for end-use parts, i.e. not for prototyping. The current limits of each design approach are discussed and the most exciting future opportunities for biomimetic AM applications are highlighted.},

The advantage of Optimal Control over Global Minimization such as in [16] is that it can handle both approximation and interpolation. Moreover a cost function is introduced to implement a design objective (shortest curve, smoothest one etc...). The present work introduces the Optimal Control over the knot vectors of non-uniform B-Splines. Violation of Schoenberg-Whitney condition is dealt naturally within the Optimal Control framework. A geometric description of the resulting null space is provided as well.},

It is a nonparametric statistical method that does not rely on distributional or dependency structure assumptions. The method is motivated by and applied to varved (annually laminated) sediment data from lake Kassjo¨n in northern Sweden, aiming to infer on past environmental and climate changes. The resulting clusters and their time dynamics show great potential for seasonal climate interpretation, in particular for winter climate changes.},

Being a hot process operating in vacuum environment with x-rays and material vaporization among by-products, in-situ sensing and monitoring presents more challenges than in laser powder bed fusion. However, an automated and robust detection of unstable process conditions represents a key capability to meet challenging qualiﬁcation requirements imposed by industry. This study presents novel in-situ monitoring methods based on high spatial resolution imaging for powder bed homogeneity monitoring and high temporal resolution video-imaging for hot-spot detection, i.e., the detection of anomalous local heat accumulations.},

	abstract = {The production of novel types of complex shapes is nowadays enabled by new manufacturing paradigms such as additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing. The continuous increase of shape complexity imposes new challenges in terms of inspection, product qualification and process monitoring methodologies. Previously proposed methods for 2.5D freeform surfaces are no longer applicable in the presence of this kind of new full 3D geometries. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by presenting a statistical quality monitoring approach for structures that cannot be described in terms of parametric models. The goal consists of identifying out-of-control geometrical distortions by analyzing either local variations within the part or changes from part to part. The proposed approach involves an innovative solution for modeling the deviation between the nominal geometry (the originating 3D model) and the real geometry (measured via x-ray computed tomography) by slicing the shapes and estimating the deviation slice by slice. 3D deviation maps are then transformed into 1D deviation profiles enabling the use of a profile monitoring scheme for local defect detection. The feasibility and potential of this method are demonstrated by focusing on a category of complex shapes where an elemental geometry regularly repeats in space. These shapes are known as lattice structures, or metamaterials, and their trabecular shape is thought to provide innovative mechanical and functional performance. The performance of the proposed method is shown in real and simulated case studies.},

However, their several beneﬁts can be adversely affected by local defects and geometrical deviations, which can be hardly identiﬁed via ex-situ metrology. This paper is the ﬁrst to prove that lattice structure inspection can be implemented in-situ, tackling the uncertainty of in-process imaging. The method combines powder bed image segmentation with robust statistical modelling to translate the in-line 3D geometry reconstruction into a 1D representation of unit cell’s properties. Results demonstrate the agreement between in-situ modelling and ex-situ ground-truth inspections.},
